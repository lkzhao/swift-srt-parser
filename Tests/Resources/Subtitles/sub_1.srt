1
00:00:07,524 --> 00:00:08,684
Are you ready?

2
00:00:28,044 --> 00:00:31,424
Ms O'Riordan, this is a really
serious offence.

3
00:00:31,524 --> 00:00:33,664
You understand this, yes?

4
00:00:33,764 --> 00:00:35,384
Yeah.

5
00:00:35,484 --> 00:00:38,464
Has the victim made a statement?
Yes, sir.

6
00:00:38,564 --> 00:00:41,024
She says, "I knew Orla meant me
no harm

7
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,504
"and I beg you to go easy on her."

8
00:00:43,604 --> 00:00:45,424
Thank you.

9
00:00:45,524 --> 00:00:49,544
Ms O'Riordan, the tariff starts at
35 days plus another seven

10
00:00:49,644 --> 00:00:51,984
because you physically took hold
of the victim.

11
00:00:52,084 --> 00:00:55,224
But there are some
mitigating factors.

12
00:00:55,324 --> 00:00:58,264
Your children going into care
is one.

13
00:00:58,364 --> 00:01:00,064
Your good behaviour...

14
00:01:00,164 --> 00:01:03,304
Excellent, you said, Officer Martin?
Yes, sir.

15
00:01:03,404 --> 00:01:05,104
Your excellent behaviour.

16
00:01:05,204 --> 00:01:08,024
And, of course, the fact that
you pleaded guilty.

17
00:01:08,124 --> 00:01:12,164
Mrs O'Riordan, you will serve an
extra 20 days in prison.

18
00:01:15,964 --> 00:01:17,884
Thanks.

19
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,684
Thank you.

20
00:01:42,324 --> 00:01:43,604
You're back, then?

21
00:01:49,764 --> 00:01:51,444
You delivered Kelsey's baby?

22
00:01:52,524 --> 00:01:54,344
Yeah.

23
00:01:54,444 --> 00:01:55,684
No officer, or...?

24
00:01:57,044 --> 00:02:01,284
No. They were all watching
your little show, weren't they?

25
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:04,764
I didn't know.

26
00:02:06,764 --> 00:02:07,804
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:26,084 --> 00:02:28,004
Oh, my God.

28
00:02:29,724 --> 00:02:32,284
Aw, wow!

29
00:02:33,524 --> 00:02:34,564
Look at him.

30
00:02:35,764 --> 00:02:37,464
He's perfect.

31
00:02:37,564 --> 00:02:38,604
Yeah, he is.

32
00:02:41,724 --> 00:02:43,304
Would you like to hold him?

33
00:02:43,404 --> 00:02:45,664
Oh, no... No, please, hold him.

34
00:02:45,764 --> 00:02:47,444
Please. I'd like you to.

35
00:02:48,764 --> 00:02:51,784
Are you sure? Yeah, I'd
really like that.

36
00:02:51,884 --> 00:02:53,624
All right.

37
00:02:53,724 --> 00:02:55,064
There you go.

38
00:02:55,164 --> 00:02:57,724
Sh... Ooh, shh...

39
00:02:59,164 --> 00:03:01,304
Aw! It's OK...

40
00:03:01,404 --> 00:03:03,124
There you go.

41
00:03:04,204 --> 00:03:06,464
Oh, Kelsey.

42
00:03:06,564 --> 00:03:09,144
He's only little, but he's a
right milk monster.

43
00:03:09,244 --> 00:03:11,924
Are you feeding him yourself? Yeah.
I am, yeah. Mm.

44
00:03:14,164 --> 00:03:15,644
What's his name?

45
00:03:18,644 --> 00:03:20,364
Daniel.

46
00:03:36,444 --> 00:03:38,524
I can't... It's OK, it's OK.

47
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,524
There he is.

48
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,544
You let me down, Adam.

49
00:03:52,644 --> 00:03:54,264
You got it anyway, babe.

50
00:03:54,364 --> 00:03:56,224
You got the mother and baby unit.

51
00:03:56,324 --> 00:03:59,784
Yeah, no thanks to you.
You've let me down big time.

52
00:03:59,884 --> 00:04:01,864
Where is he now, babe?

53
00:04:01,964 --> 00:04:04,024
Where's the baby?

54
00:04:04,124 --> 00:04:05,244
He's asleep.

55
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,144
Let me come and see him, Kels.

56
00:04:09,244 --> 00:04:10,624
Yeah?

57
00:04:10,724 --> 00:04:13,384
Let me come and see
little baby Adam.

58
00:04:13,484 --> 00:04:15,404
It's Daniel.

59
00:04:17,484 --> 00:04:20,424
I thought you were going to
name him Adam.

60
00:04:20,524 --> 00:04:21,824
After me.

61
00:04:21,924 --> 00:04:23,664
Well, I didn't. It's Daniel.

62
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,424
And it's too late to
change that now.

63
00:04:25,524 --> 00:04:27,524
That's OK, babe. Just...

64
00:04:29,084 --> 00:04:30,824
..let me come and see little Daniel.

65
00:04:30,924 --> 00:04:32,904
I've got to go.

66
00:04:33,004 --> 00:04:34,984
No, look. Listen, Kels...

67
00:04:35,084 --> 00:04:36,724
He's crying. Babe...

68
00:04:43,164 --> 00:04:45,224
I think he's got a little bit
of wind,

69
00:04:45,324 --> 00:04:47,104
his little legs keep lifting up.

70
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:50,604
Oh, baba, come here. There you go.

71
00:04:52,284 --> 00:04:55,104
Is it wind hurting my baba? Is it?

72
00:04:55,204 --> 00:04:56,584
Is it wind?

73
00:04:56,684 --> 00:04:58,604
Come here.

74
00:05:10,124 --> 00:05:12,384
Hi, Maeve. Hi, miss.

75
00:05:12,484 --> 00:05:14,544
Do you mind if I close this?

76
00:05:14,644 --> 00:05:16,464
What's it about? Is it bad news?

77
00:05:16,564 --> 00:05:19,024
No. Well, nothing to do
with your family or anyone,

78
00:05:19,124 --> 00:05:20,424
so do you mind?

79
00:05:20,524 --> 00:05:22,144
Right. Yeah.

80
00:05:22,244 --> 00:05:24,784
Lou's had a bit of good news.

81
00:05:24,884 --> 00:05:27,084
A card from her son, yeah. Great.

82
00:05:29,324 --> 00:05:31,944
You two still close? Yeah.

83
00:05:32,044 --> 00:05:33,584
Not had a fallout?

84
00:05:33,684 --> 00:05:35,124
No. Why?

85
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:40,444
Maeve, her son didn't send
that card. Someone else did.

86
00:05:42,244 --> 00:05:43,784
How do you know that?

87
00:05:43,884 --> 00:05:45,944
I phoned him. Right.

88
00:05:46,044 --> 00:05:48,464
And why are you telling ME this?
What...?

89
00:05:48,564 --> 00:05:50,764
You think I sent it?

90
00:05:51,764 --> 00:05:53,784
I think someone you know sent it.

91
00:05:53,884 --> 00:05:55,284
Someone on the outside.

92
00:05:57,004 --> 00:05:59,104
Why would they do that?

93
00:05:59,204 --> 00:06:01,124
Because you asked them to.

94
00:06:06,844 --> 00:06:09,164
I only did it to see
her face light up.

95
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:11,984
I know.

96
00:06:12,084 --> 00:06:13,924
I know you didn't do it maliciously.

97
00:06:16,204 --> 00:06:18,364
So what are you going to
do about it?

98
00:06:21,284 --> 00:06:22,844
I don't know.

99
00:06:32,324 --> 00:06:33,784
No Kyle?

100
00:06:33,884 --> 00:06:35,004
No.

101
00:06:36,244 --> 00:06:39,644
Can I get you a drink?
No, I'm all right. Hey.

102
00:06:53,404 --> 00:06:55,544
What...?! I don't want it!

103
00:06:55,644 --> 00:06:56,824
What? Take it back.

104
00:06:56,924 --> 00:06:59,784
Don't be so stupid.
You're the stupid one. Shh!

105
00:06:59,884 --> 00:07:03,504
What have I done? You prick.
What have I done?

106
00:07:03,604 --> 00:07:04,824
You know I've packed it in.

107
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,704
You're always saying that, Kelsey.

108
00:07:06,804 --> 00:07:08,184
No, I HAVE packed in this time.

109
00:07:08,284 --> 00:07:10,984
You're going to have to come with
us, Morgan. Wha...? No, I didn't...

110
00:07:11,084 --> 00:07:13,344
Listen, I... Will you sit down
and remain seated, please?

111
00:07:13,444 --> 00:07:16,304
I didn't mean for any of this.
It wasn't planned...
He's passed you something

112
00:07:16,404 --> 00:07:19,464
and we need to see what it is.
It's something we used to do, but

113
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,184
he didn't know I didn't want to do
it any more. Move, please. Kelsey.

114
00:07:22,284 --> 00:07:24,224
Everyone knows I've packed it in!

115
00:07:24,324 --> 00:07:26,984
Ask anyone in this nick and they'll
tell you that I've packed it in.

116
00:07:27,084 --> 00:07:30,344
But he didn't believe that, that's
why he done this. It's not me.

117
00:07:30,444 --> 00:07:33,123
It's got nowt to do
with me, it's him!

118
00:07:37,284 --> 00:07:39,304
In you go.

119
00:07:39,404 --> 00:07:41,204
They'll take the baby off her.

120
00:07:42,284 --> 00:07:43,524
Can they do that?

121
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,024
Oh, yes.

122
00:07:46,124 --> 00:07:48,024
It wasn't my idea, honest.

123
00:07:48,124 --> 00:07:50,984
Sit down. Take it out and show
it to us, please. It wasn't!

124
00:07:51,084 --> 00:07:53,864
I didn't know he was going to do it.
If I did, I'd've done it properly.

125
00:07:53,964 --> 00:07:56,664
Sit down. Take it out...
I would've swallowed it...

126
00:07:56,764 --> 00:07:59,344
..and show it to me, please. And you
wouldn't have seen anything.

127
00:07:59,444 --> 00:08:01,164
Show it to me, please, Kelsey.

128
00:08:17,324 --> 00:08:19,104
Could you take her through, please?

129
00:08:19,204 --> 00:08:22,084
What's going to happen?
What's going to happen, miss?

130
00:08:35,804 --> 00:08:37,444
Shh...

131
00:08:52,564 --> 00:08:55,004
Erm, listen.
I've been seeing someone.

132
00:08:56,844 --> 00:08:58,264
Right.

133
00:08:58,364 --> 00:08:59,884
Sahira.

134
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,344
How long have you been together?

135
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,124
About 18 months now.

136
00:09:09,084 --> 00:09:10,564
Serious, then?

137
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:13,124
Yeah.

138
00:09:14,564 --> 00:09:16,744
What does she do?

139
00:09:16,844 --> 00:09:18,264
Uh, she's...

140
00:09:18,364 --> 00:09:21,184
She's a nurse. Yeah. Yes.

141
00:09:21,284 --> 00:09:23,164
At your hospital. Yes.

142
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,004
Why are you smiling?

143
00:09:29,764 --> 00:09:31,104
Just am. Yeah.

144
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:32,924
Well, she's pregnant.

145
00:09:36,324 --> 00:09:38,184
Yeah, so, um...

146
00:09:38,284 --> 00:09:40,644
I just...
I need to ask you something.

147
00:09:42,804 --> 00:09:45,304
What was the biggest thing
that I did wrong?

148
00:09:45,404 --> 00:09:46,824
Nothing.

149
00:09:46,924 --> 00:09:50,784
Nothing, you're not to blame in
any way... I was. ..whatsoever.

150
00:09:50,884 --> 00:09:53,804
And I...know that I did a lot
of things wrong...

151
00:09:55,244 --> 00:09:58,444
..but...what was the biggest?

152
00:10:05,484 --> 00:10:08,524
The harder I found it,
the more you looked away.

153
00:10:26,044 --> 00:10:27,784
Right, erm...

154
00:10:27,884 --> 00:10:30,504
Someone from children's services
is coming

155
00:10:30,604 --> 00:10:34,344
and they're going to take the baby
for a while. For a while? Yeah.

156
00:10:34,444 --> 00:10:36,464
Will I get him back? Yeah.

157
00:10:36,564 --> 00:10:37,764
When?

158
00:10:39,284 --> 00:10:41,264
When will I get him back?

159
00:10:41,364 --> 00:10:42,624
I don't know.

160
00:10:42,724 --> 00:10:45,344
I'm never going to get him back,
then, if you say it like that...

161
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:47,504
Don't start thinking that.
Well, when, then?

162
00:10:47,604 --> 00:10:50,424
You just keep doing what you're
doing, keep your head straight,

163
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,584
and you'll get him back,
but today...

164
00:10:52,684 --> 00:10:55,424
They're not getting him.
You put it in the baby's clothing.

165
00:10:55,524 --> 00:10:58,064
Maybe if you hadn't have
done that... I panicked! Didn't I?

166
00:10:58,164 --> 00:11:00,004
Didn't know what I was doing!

167
00:11:01,004 --> 00:11:02,864
Should you feed him?

168
00:11:02,964 --> 00:11:05,784
No. Because he's not going nowhere.

169
00:11:05,884 --> 00:11:08,224
I know you love him.

170
00:11:08,324 --> 00:11:10,864
I love him more than anything.

171
00:11:10,964 --> 00:11:12,264
Then hand him over,

172
00:11:12,364 --> 00:11:15,424
because if you resist, they're still
going to have to take him...

173
00:11:15,524 --> 00:11:17,944
They're not taking him.
..and it might hurt him.

174
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,144
This is not the end.
They're not getting him!

175
00:11:20,244 --> 00:11:22,384
It might take a bit of time,
but you can get him back.

176
00:11:22,484 --> 00:11:25,184
They're not getting him!
It's definitely not the end...

177
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,824
They're not getting him. ..honestly.
They're not getting him!

178
00:11:27,924 --> 00:11:30,544
But the...first thing you've got
to do... They're not taking him!

179
00:11:30,644 --> 00:11:32,904
..is hand him over peacefully.
They're not getting him!

180
00:11:33,004 --> 00:11:35,104
Because if you resist,
i-it could ruin your chances

181
00:11:35,204 --> 00:11:37,744
of ever getting him back...
You like your job, do you?

182
00:11:37,844 --> 00:11:42,024
Yeah. But you like this most of all,
don't you?

183
00:11:42,124 --> 00:11:44,524
Taking babies off mothers!

184
00:11:49,804 --> 00:11:51,404
You couldn't be more wrong.

185
00:12:01,964 --> 00:12:03,524
Why did you do it?

186
00:12:04,964 --> 00:12:06,964
I mean, there was your mother.
Right?

187
00:12:08,844 --> 00:12:11,644
"I can't cope, Mum.
Can you come and stay?"

188
00:12:12,804 --> 00:12:14,324
That's better than...

189
00:12:15,604 --> 00:12:17,464
Did you just not think of that?

190
00:12:17,564 --> 00:12:19,024
How far gone is she?

191
00:12:19,124 --> 00:12:22,384
Or the woman next door. You know,
she's an experienced mother.

192
00:12:22,484 --> 00:12:26,504
All you had to do was say, "I need
a little bit of help."

193
00:12:26,604 --> 00:12:29,624
But you... Did you just not think
of that?

194
00:12:29,724 --> 00:12:31,484
Why did you do it?

195
00:12:33,964 --> 00:12:35,644
For fuck's sake, Abi.

196
00:12:37,444 --> 00:12:39,364
I mean, yeah, as bad as I was...

197
00:12:41,244 --> 00:12:42,724
..why did you do it?

198
00:12:46,684 --> 00:12:47,964
I don't know.

199
00:12:49,844 --> 00:12:51,724
Yeah...

200
00:13:24,124 --> 00:13:25,524
Shall I take him?

201
00:13:42,604 --> 00:13:44,444
Can I?

202
00:14:01,644 --> 00:14:02,684
Come on.

203
00:15:36,724 --> 00:15:38,684
I'm sorry, Kels.

204
00:16:45,284 --> 00:16:47,284
Do you want your baby back, Kels?

205
00:16:48,804 --> 00:16:50,724
Yeah. Yeah?

206
00:16:53,204 --> 00:16:54,964
Then keep off that stuff.

207
00:17:01,204 --> 00:17:02,764
Thanks.

208
00:17:20,124 --> 00:17:21,324
Hi.

209
00:17:23,044 --> 00:17:24,524
Come on in, Lou.

210
00:17:28,084 --> 00:17:29,684
Who's dead?

211
00:17:30,964 --> 00:17:32,044
No-one.

212
00:17:34,964 --> 00:17:36,804
What's all this, then?

213
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:52,964
You sent that card?

214
00:17:54,404 --> 00:17:56,484
I'm so sorry.

215
00:17:57,764 --> 00:18:00,284
I'm so, so, so, so sorry.

216
00:18:04,404 --> 00:18:06,124
I didn't do it to hurt her.

217
00:18:08,324 --> 00:18:10,764
It wasn't a wind-up
or anything like that.

218
00:18:27,124 --> 00:18:28,344
Hello?

219
00:18:28,444 --> 00:18:30,224
Hi, Kyle.

220
00:18:30,324 --> 00:18:31,564
Grandma's died.

221
00:18:36,644 --> 00:18:37,904
When?

222
00:18:38,004 --> 00:18:40,084
Really early...this morning.

223
00:18:41,164 --> 00:18:42,884
The hospice phoned.

224
00:18:44,524 --> 00:18:45,564
Right.

225
00:18:47,204 --> 00:18:49,404
What did she want? Burial or...?
Crem.

226
00:18:50,724 --> 00:18:52,904
Definitely a crem.

227
00:18:53,004 --> 00:18:54,164
Will you come to it?

228
00:18:56,684 --> 00:18:58,444
I'll ask.

229
00:19:00,084 --> 00:19:01,904
But I might be in handcuffs.

230
00:19:02,004 --> 00:19:03,964
Why? Erm...

231
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:07,523
Because I got into a bit of trouble.

232
00:19:10,924 --> 00:19:12,404
I'll see you, though.

233
00:19:13,564 --> 00:19:15,723
Won't I? I'll see you?

234
00:19:17,084 --> 00:19:18,123
I need to go.

235
00:19:32,644 --> 00:19:34,904
The family would like to pass on
their thanks

236
00:19:35,004 --> 00:19:36,144
to the Willow Care Hospice

237
00:19:36,244 --> 00:19:39,904
who looked after Elizabeth and made
her as comfortable as possible

238
00:19:40,004 --> 00:19:42,024
in her final months.

239
00:19:42,124 --> 00:19:46,764
Elizabeth had a lot of love for her
four shining lights.

240
00:19:47,804 --> 00:19:49,384
Kyle,

241
00:19:49,484 --> 00:19:52,424
Callum, Nancy and Orla.

242
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,384
And one of them, her daughter Orla,

243
00:19:55,484 --> 00:19:58,004
is now going to say
a few of her own words.

244
00:20:04,724 --> 00:20:05,764
Thank you.

245
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,504
Well, I'm not telling any secrets

246
00:20:15,604 --> 00:20:17,963
when I say me mam were fond
of a drink.

247
00:20:19,204 --> 00:20:21,123
Hey, but we all make mistakes.

248
00:20:23,964 --> 00:20:25,684
She were an alcoholic.

249
00:20:27,284 --> 00:20:29,624
She'd been one all me life, me mam.

250
00:20:29,724 --> 00:20:30,844
She fought it, but...

251
00:20:32,004 --> 00:20:33,684
..she very rarely won.

252
00:20:34,764 --> 00:20:36,804
But there were this one day...

253
00:20:38,164 --> 00:20:40,204
Kyle's first Holy Communion.

254
00:20:42,084 --> 00:20:45,704
We'd been to Mass and were coming
back t'church hall

255
00:20:45,804 --> 00:20:48,184
and they opened the bar.

256
00:20:48,284 --> 00:20:50,604
And I weren't expecting that,
and me mam weren't.

257
00:20:51,804 --> 00:20:54,164
And I thought,
"If she touches one drop...

258
00:20:55,644 --> 00:20:57,924
"..I'm going and I'm taking Kyle
wi' me."

259
00:20:59,084 --> 00:21:01,224
I mean, Kyle were having
the time of his life,

260
00:21:01,324 --> 00:21:03,104
playing with kids
his own age and...

261
00:21:03,204 --> 00:21:05,604
..getting money off adults.
But sod it.

262
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,524
He's coming wi' me.

263
00:21:12,244 --> 00:21:14,524
But she did not touch one drop.

264
00:21:16,524 --> 00:21:19,144
She probably battered it
when she got home,

265
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:20,804
but in that church hall...

266
00:21:22,124 --> 00:21:24,864
..she stayed to the bitter end

267
00:21:24,964 --> 00:21:27,084
and she did not touch one drop.

268
00:21:28,604 --> 00:21:30,804
She were my hero that day.

269
00:21:47,204 --> 00:21:49,624
Nice to see you. Well done, love.

270
00:21:49,724 --> 00:21:51,344
So sad. Thank you.

271
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:53,044
Bye, see you soon. So sorry.

272
00:21:54,164 --> 00:21:55,204
Hiya. One minute.

273
00:21:56,924 --> 00:21:58,204
Please take 'em off.

274
00:21:59,364 --> 00:22:00,484
Please.

275
00:22:09,004 --> 00:22:10,264
Thank you.

276
00:22:10,364 --> 00:22:11,724
Hey, come here.

277
00:22:13,244 --> 00:22:15,064
Right, it's all right, yeah?

278
00:22:15,164 --> 00:22:20,064
It's going to be all right.
I'm going to see you soon. OK?

279
00:22:20,164 --> 00:22:24,464
I love you. Love you. Love you.

280
00:22:24,564 --> 00:22:26,464
OK? You tell your brother...

281
00:22:26,564 --> 00:22:29,624
You tell your brother
that I love him, all right?

282
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:31,244
I've got to go.

283
00:22:43,484 --> 00:22:44,624
Babe?

284
00:22:44,724 --> 00:22:46,344
Hiya.

285
00:22:46,444 --> 00:22:48,004
Kels, I'm sorry, babe.

286
00:22:50,324 --> 00:22:53,204
I'm really...really, really sorry,
babe.

287
00:22:54,204 --> 00:22:55,804
Right.

288
00:22:57,964 --> 00:22:59,604
What are you going to do?

289
00:23:01,724 --> 00:23:03,624
I'm going to get him back.

290
00:23:03,724 --> 00:23:05,464
How, babe?

291
00:23:05,564 --> 00:23:07,624
I mean, that's good, yeah,

292
00:23:07,724 --> 00:23:09,264
but how are you going to do that?

293
00:23:09,364 --> 00:23:11,344
That's why I'm phoning.

294
00:23:11,444 --> 00:23:13,324
I'm going to tell the truth.

295
00:23:14,724 --> 00:23:17,304
If I'm going to get him back,
I've got to get out of this place,

296
00:23:17,404 --> 00:23:20,384
so I'm going to tell the truth.
And what is the truth?

297
00:23:20,484 --> 00:23:22,444
You know what the truth is, Adam.

298
00:23:24,524 --> 00:23:26,364
And who are you going
to tell this to?

299
00:23:28,004 --> 00:23:29,744
The bizzies.

300
00:23:29,844 --> 00:23:31,264
What?

301
00:23:31,364 --> 00:23:33,224
The bizzies!

302
00:23:33,324 --> 00:23:35,264
So you're grassing on me?

303
00:23:35,364 --> 00:23:37,424
Uh... I'm telling the truth!

304
00:23:37,524 --> 00:23:39,144
Well, I'm telling you this, babe,

305
00:23:39,244 --> 00:23:40,824
if you go near those bizzies,

306
00:23:40,924 --> 00:23:45,304
if you even THINK about bubbling me
to those bizzies, you're dead.

307
00:23:45,404 --> 00:23:47,784
You're dead and your baby's dead.

308
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:50,304
Yeah, and don't think I won't be
able to do it

309
00:23:50,404 --> 00:23:51,984
because I'll be banged up.

310
00:23:52,084 --> 00:23:54,544
Because I'll just slip someone in
your nick a bit of brown,

311
00:23:54,644 --> 00:23:57,444
and some slag, a little bit of
brown, and she'll do it for me.

312
00:23:58,924 --> 00:24:02,084
She'll cut you
and your baby's throat.

313
00:24:19,404 --> 00:24:20,644
Send him down, Kels.

314
00:24:23,244 --> 00:24:25,084
Send him down.

315
00:24:41,444 --> 00:24:44,604
All right?
Yeah, have you got a minute? Yeah.

316
00:24:49,724 --> 00:24:52,144
Yeah, my son's coming to see me.

317
00:24:52,244 --> 00:24:54,144
I'm pleased for you, Lou.

318
00:24:54,244 --> 00:24:57,284
Yeah, it's not a visit.
It's one of them...

319
00:24:58,324 --> 00:25:00,624
..you know,
restorative justice things.

320
00:25:00,724 --> 00:25:02,424
Right.

321
00:25:02,524 --> 00:25:03,904
So, uh...

322
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:05,924
Yeah, I was wondering if...

323
00:25:07,044 --> 00:25:09,064
Would you come?

324
00:25:09,164 --> 00:25:10,224
Me?

325
00:25:10,324 --> 00:25:13,004
Well, I like you and...

326
00:25:14,044 --> 00:25:17,184
I thought you might be all right
with it and...

327
00:25:17,284 --> 00:25:18,324
Go on.

328
00:25:21,044 --> 00:25:23,084
I'm an alcoholic.

329
00:25:27,524 --> 00:25:28,564
Right.

330
00:25:41,964 --> 00:25:43,484
Come in. Sit yourselves down. Yep.

331
00:25:46,404 --> 00:25:48,184
Um...

332
00:25:48,284 --> 00:25:52,024
OK, so I know everyone,
so I'll do some intros.

333
00:25:52,124 --> 00:25:57,104
I'm Marie-Louise. I'm chaplain here.
This is Prison Officer Carter.

334
00:25:57,204 --> 00:26:01,364
This is Orla, who is here
to support Lou, yes? Yeah.

335
00:26:02,684 --> 00:26:05,804
This is Stephen.
This is Lou's son, Stephen.

336
00:26:14,884 --> 00:26:16,804
I've always hated myself.

337
00:26:18,804 --> 00:26:20,404
That's where the booze came in.

338
00:26:22,364 --> 00:26:24,724
You can never forget you hate
yourself, but...

339
00:26:26,124 --> 00:26:28,224
..getting pissed helps a bit.

340
00:26:28,324 --> 00:26:30,744
Trouble is, the more pissed you get,

341
00:26:30,844 --> 00:26:32,664
the more you act like an idiot

342
00:26:32,764 --> 00:26:34,964
and the more you hate yourself
the next day.

343
00:26:38,124 --> 00:26:39,284
So, uh...

344
00:26:41,844 --> 00:26:43,804
Yeah, I started to be other people.

345
00:26:45,564 --> 00:26:48,164
Anybody. Anybody apart from me.

346
00:26:49,404 --> 00:26:53,624
And I told myself, I wisnae drinking
because I hated myself,

347
00:26:53,724 --> 00:26:56,084
I was drinking because I was
rock and roll.

348
00:26:57,684 --> 00:26:59,004
A bit wild.

349
00:27:02,764 --> 00:27:05,824
And that's what I was on the day
I punched Anna.

350
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:07,504
I was...

351
00:27:07,604 --> 00:27:10,884
I was just rabbiting on
and she came up to me and said...

352
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:14,204
.."Why are you behaving like this?"

353
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:21,684
It was...so simple.

354
00:27:22,804 --> 00:27:24,444
So clear.

355
00:27:28,404 --> 00:27:31,924
And so impossible for me to answer
so I punched her.

356
00:27:34,124 --> 00:27:35,964
And she went down.

357
00:27:38,124 --> 00:27:39,164
And...

358
00:27:41,564 --> 00:27:44,184
I had to pretend
that I didn't regret it

359
00:27:44,284 --> 00:27:46,124
in any way whatsoever because...

360
00:27:47,244 --> 00:27:49,844
..because I was rock and roll.
I was wild.

361
00:27:54,564 --> 00:27:57,404
But all I wanted to do was pick
her up and say, "I'm sorry.

362
00:27:59,084 --> 00:28:01,884
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."

363
00:28:07,244 --> 00:28:08,284
But...I didn't.

364
00:28:10,924 --> 00:28:13,864
And that was the last time
I ever touched a drink.

365
00:28:13,964 --> 00:28:16,184
I mean, this is a prison, yeah,

366
00:28:16,284 --> 00:28:17,904
but there's booze...

367
00:28:18,004 --> 00:28:20,844
There's even more drugs,
but I've never touched a thing.

368
00:28:25,124 --> 00:28:27,604
Deep down, I always wanted to talk
to you about it.

369
00:28:29,204 --> 00:28:32,004
But I thought if I did that,
I would be betraying Anna.

370
00:28:35,364 --> 00:28:37,284
But it was Anna who told me to come.

371
00:28:39,364 --> 00:28:44,404
She's not up to seeing you yet,
but she wanted me to come and...

372
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:49,084
..I'd like to come again,
if that's OK, because...

373
00:28:50,524 --> 00:28:52,384
Well...

374
00:28:52,484 --> 00:28:54,644
It's been nice to finally
meet you, Mum.

375
00:28:57,684 --> 00:28:59,644
I'd love that.

376
00:29:03,964 --> 00:29:05,404
Thank you.

377
00:29:12,404 --> 00:29:15,504
I can't get this one tight like
I did the other one.

378
00:29:15,604 --> 00:29:16,864
It's so annoying.

379
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:19,944
I don't even know why you need that
string. I just make it up, I do.

380
00:29:20,044 --> 00:29:22,784
Hey, check this out... Eh?
Look at this...

381
00:29:22,884 --> 00:29:24,763
Have you seen that wizard thing...?

382
00:29:28,804 --> 00:29:30,324
Maeve?

383
00:29:51,844 --> 00:29:53,124
I'm sorry.

384
00:30:14,884 --> 00:30:16,984
Calling on the case of the Crown

385
00:30:17,084 --> 00:30:20,224
versus Adam Muller
and Kelsey Morgan.

386
00:30:20,324 --> 00:30:23,624
Mr Muller stands accused
of the importation of drugs,

387
00:30:23,724 --> 00:30:27,624
supplying class A drugs into prison,
and threats to kill.

388
00:30:27,724 --> 00:30:30,744
Miss Morgan stands accused
of the importation of drugs

389
00:30:30,844 --> 00:30:34,024
into the country, and smuggling
drugs into Carlingford Prison,

390
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:37,384
where she's currently on remand.

391
00:30:37,484 --> 00:30:40,984
Your Honour,
my client, following her plea,

392
00:30:41,084 --> 00:30:43,664
would like to give evidence
for the prosecution.

393
00:30:43,764 --> 00:30:45,244
Very well.

394
00:30:47,044 --> 00:30:50,324
I call Kelsey Morgan to the stand.

395
00:30:54,084 --> 00:30:57,064
Well, I'm telling you
this, if you go near those bizzies,

396
00:30:57,164 --> 00:31:01,664
if you even THINK about bubbling me
to those bizzies, you're dead.

397
00:31:01,764 --> 00:31:05,064
Because I'll just slip someone
in your nick a bit of brown

398
00:31:05,164 --> 00:31:08,884
and she'll cut you
and your baby's throat.

399
00:31:14,204 --> 00:31:18,744
I was a heroin addict.
I was trying to come off it.

400
00:31:18,844 --> 00:31:21,624
And my mate and her fella
were going to Spain,

401
00:31:21,724 --> 00:31:25,504
and they wanted to get me away from
Adam and from where I was living.

402
00:31:25,604 --> 00:31:27,304
It was all drugs.

403
00:31:27,404 --> 00:31:31,464
Um, so they took me with them.
And it was great for a bit.

404
00:31:31,564 --> 00:31:34,744
I was rattling but I was doing OK.

405
00:31:34,844 --> 00:31:37,184
Then Adam showed up.

406
00:31:37,284 --> 00:31:39,984
Told me I was stupid
to be rattling in Spain.

407
00:31:40,084 --> 00:31:43,064
If I wanted to turkey,
turkey back home, not here in Spain,

408
00:31:43,164 --> 00:31:45,664
cos Spain's for spoiling yourself.

409
00:31:45,764 --> 00:31:47,704
So I went back on it.

410
00:31:47,804 --> 00:31:50,544
Me and Adam flew home together.

411
00:31:50,644 --> 00:31:53,224
They wouldn't let me through
the green channel,

412
00:31:53,324 --> 00:31:58,624
they opened my bag and inside there
was a package of heroin, a kilo.

413
00:31:58,724 --> 00:32:01,344
A kilo of heroin.

414
00:32:01,444 --> 00:32:05,244
And Adam was suddenly
nowhere to be seen.

415
00:32:09,044 --> 00:32:11,464
He visited me on remand.

416
00:32:11,564 --> 00:32:13,264
And he told me that he loved me

417
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:18,124
and that I was going down anyway so
please don't take him down with me.

418
00:32:19,124 --> 00:32:22,184
Is Adam in this courtroom?

419
00:32:22,284 --> 00:32:23,884
Yeah. He's there.

420
00:32:25,324 --> 00:32:28,664
Did you see him
put the package in your bag?

421
00:32:28,764 --> 00:32:30,464
Yes.

422
00:32:30,564 --> 00:32:32,784
Did you think it was drugs?

423
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:34,324
Yeah.

424
00:32:35,724 --> 00:32:38,784
Did you ask him if it was drugs?
Yes.

425
00:32:38,884 --> 00:32:41,224
He said no,
it was a present for his mother.

426
00:32:41,324 --> 00:32:43,904
You knew that was a lie. Yeah,

427
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:46,264
but I couldn't call him a liar,
could I?

428
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:49,484
I couldn't call him a liar, cos
I was too scared to call him a liar.

429
00:32:55,044 --> 00:32:58,024
Miss Morgan,
I can only imagine the distress

430
00:32:58,124 --> 00:33:02,224
that having your baby removed
would have caused you.

431
00:33:02,324 --> 00:33:04,184
It is for this reason

432
00:33:04,284 --> 00:33:07,264
and the fact that you have
assisted the prosecution

433
00:33:07,364 --> 00:33:09,464
and that you pleaded guilty

434
00:33:09,564 --> 00:33:14,184
that I sentence you to
two-and-a-half years in prison.

435
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,144
Taking into account the nine months

436
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,144
that you've already spent
on remand,

437
00:33:18,244 --> 00:33:21,224
which was longer than usual
due to your pregnancy,

438
00:33:21,324 --> 00:33:26,384
you will serve a further six months
before you will be released.

439
00:33:26,484 --> 00:33:28,084
Thank you.

440
00:33:30,124 --> 00:33:31,704
Mr Muller,

441
00:33:31,804 --> 00:33:35,664
the sentence I consider appropriate
for the importation of drugs

442
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:38,024
is one of ten years.

443
00:33:38,124 --> 00:33:42,504
For the supply of class A drugs
into prison - five years.

444
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:45,984
And for threats
to kill Miss Morgan - two years.

445
00:33:46,084 --> 00:33:48,984
You will serve these sentences
concurrently,

446
00:33:49,084 --> 00:33:52,924
meaning a total
of ten years' imprisonment.

447
00:33:55,524 --> 00:33:57,504
Can you go back
to your mum's house?

448
00:33:57,604 --> 00:33:59,984
No, she rented it.
Private landlord.

449
00:34:00,084 --> 00:34:02,104
That's a problem,
then. Is it?

450
00:34:02,204 --> 00:34:04,024
Yeah. It's getting
harder to find places

451
00:34:04,124 --> 00:34:05,464
for people
leaving prison.

452
00:34:05,564 --> 00:34:09,304
We haven't got anywhere for you,
Orla. All the hostels are full.

453
00:34:09,404 --> 00:34:12,544
Well...what do I do?

454
00:34:12,644 --> 00:34:15,784
We can give you a tent. What?

455
00:34:15,884 --> 00:34:17,284
A tent.

456
00:34:18,404 --> 00:34:21,304
You're thinking of sending me
out of here wi' a tent?

457
00:34:21,404 --> 00:34:22,584
Yeah.

458
00:34:22,684 --> 00:34:25,324
Is this a joke? No.

459
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:28,444
I'm sorry, Orla.

460
00:34:40,004 --> 00:34:43,524
Sending her out to live in a tent.
It's an absolute disgrace.

461
00:34:44,924 --> 00:34:46,524
I know.

462
00:34:56,084 --> 00:34:58,424
Right, come here.

463
00:34:58,524 --> 00:35:01,124
Bye, sweetheart. Bye.

464
00:35:04,764 --> 00:35:06,744
Sorry for the things I said.

465
00:35:06,844 --> 00:35:09,404
It's all right.

466
00:35:10,804 --> 00:35:13,684
Look after her. Yeah.
And yourself.

467
00:35:14,844 --> 00:35:16,364
Take care, yeah?

468
00:36:35,404 --> 00:36:37,104
Hiya.

469
00:36:37,204 --> 00:36:39,524
Hiya, Mum. Are you out yet?

470
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:00,564
Ta.

471
00:37:02,084 --> 00:37:03,384
Hiya.

472
00:37:03,484 --> 00:37:05,464
Hiya.

473
00:37:05,564 --> 00:37:07,984
Can I get you something?

474
00:37:08,084 --> 00:37:10,104
Er, tea, please.

475
00:37:10,204 --> 00:37:12,624
Milk? Yeah, please.

476
00:37:12,724 --> 00:37:18,384
I know this is proper cheeky,
but could you get me some toast?

477
00:37:18,484 --> 00:37:20,424
Toast. Yeah. Right.

478
00:37:20,524 --> 00:37:22,164
Ta. Thank you.

479
00:37:28,844 --> 00:37:30,904
You OK, son? Yeah.

480
00:37:31,004 --> 00:37:35,384
Look, I'm going to say all this
before she comes back, right? Yeah.

481
00:37:35,484 --> 00:37:38,284
You know all that
not-coming-to-see-me, Kyle?

482
00:37:40,244 --> 00:37:42,224
It's cos you were ashamed?

483
00:37:42,324 --> 00:37:43,804
Yeah.

484
00:37:45,484 --> 00:37:47,764
You were ashamed
I were in prison.

485
00:37:49,084 --> 00:37:51,864
But you weren't ashamed
of what I did.

486
00:37:51,964 --> 00:37:55,424
You were ashamed
that I got caught doing it.

487
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:56,844
Yeah.

488
00:37:58,844 --> 00:38:00,324
Me too.

489
00:38:01,524 --> 00:38:05,584
I am not ashamed
of anything I have done for you,

490
00:38:05,684 --> 00:38:07,864
Callum or Nancy.

491
00:38:07,964 --> 00:38:12,104
But I won't do it again. I'll never
do anything like this again.

492
00:38:12,204 --> 00:38:13,984
I'm going to get a job,

493
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:16,064
I'm going to get us
somewhere to live

494
00:38:16,164 --> 00:38:18,944
and I am going to get us all
back together.

495
00:38:19,044 --> 00:38:21,824
I promise. Right?

496
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,324
Right.

497
00:38:24,764 --> 00:38:26,444
But you have to help.

498
00:38:30,524 --> 00:38:33,124
Treat me like your mum.

499
00:38:35,844 --> 00:38:38,104
Let me come and see you.

500
00:38:38,204 --> 00:38:39,684
Phone me.

501
00:38:45,124 --> 00:38:47,124
Love me.

502
00:38:50,204 --> 00:38:51,844
Yeah. Yeah?

503
00:39:02,524 --> 00:39:04,104
I missed you.

504
00:39:04,204 --> 00:39:06,204
Missed you, too.

505
00:39:46,924 --> 00:39:48,284
Too spicy?

506
00:40:10,764 --> 00:40:12,244
You knew?

507
00:40:14,244 --> 00:40:17,404
Shit in my food
and you didn't say anything?

508
00:40:34,444 --> 00:40:37,324
I was too scared to say anything.
I'm really sorry.

509
00:41:23,684 --> 00:41:26,024
I'm going to go get him. You're not.

510
00:41:26,124 --> 00:41:27,984
I can't take any more of this.

511
00:41:28,084 --> 00:41:30,104
We agreed to try letting him cry.

512
00:41:30,204 --> 00:41:34,024
No, we agreed to try it for a bit.
This has been hours. It hasn't.

513
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:35,524
Oh, God.

514
00:41:38,004 --> 00:41:40,344
That's pain. It's not.

515
00:41:40,444 --> 00:41:43,304
No, I'm going to go get him. Right,
well, if you bring him in here,

516
00:41:43,404 --> 00:41:45,184
I'm getting out bed,
I'm going downstairs

517
00:41:45,284 --> 00:41:46,884
and I'm leaving you to it.

518
00:41:48,204 --> 00:41:49,904
I'm sorry...

519
00:41:50,004 --> 00:41:51,883
I know...

520
00:41:58,604 --> 00:42:01,083
Naughty Mummy. I'm sorry.

521
00:42:19,084 --> 00:42:22,124
You won't believe this
but I'm not a violent person.

522
00:42:24,604 --> 00:42:28,504
But you attack me, I'll attack you.

523
00:42:28,604 --> 00:42:31,624
And I'm sick of it.

524
00:42:31,724 --> 00:42:35,104
So I'm going to tell you my story.

525
00:42:35,204 --> 00:42:38,544
I'm hoping you identify
with bits of it

526
00:42:38,644 --> 00:42:43,124
and that's enough for you
to leave me alone.

527
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:48,244
So...

528
00:42:50,644 --> 00:42:52,964
How many of you have had kids?

529
00:42:57,044 --> 00:42:58,504
Most of you.

530
00:42:58,604 --> 00:43:00,084
Well...

531
00:43:04,044 --> 00:43:07,784
Uh, we were trying for ages,

532
00:43:07,884 --> 00:43:09,204
me and Rob...

533
00:43:10,804 --> 00:43:13,604
..so when I got pregnant I was...

534
00:43:16,084 --> 00:43:17,684
..ecstatic.

535
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:24,484
Yeah, read all the books,
listed all of the names and...

536
00:43:25,604 --> 00:43:27,224
..made all the promises, you know,

537
00:43:27,324 --> 00:43:33,024
no bottle, no dummy,
nothing sweet - all that stuff.

538
00:43:33,124 --> 00:43:37,284
And then...I went into labour.

539
00:43:40,364 --> 00:43:42,164
And it was horrific.

540
00:43:43,604 --> 00:43:45,764
Two days of agony.

541
00:43:47,204 --> 00:43:49,464
Then home with a crying baby.

542
00:43:49,564 --> 00:43:54,164
And I could barely sit down
because of the pain.

543
00:43:56,564 --> 00:43:58,984
Uh, then...

544
00:43:59,084 --> 00:44:02,664
..the nurse came and she
stripped him and weighed him

545
00:44:02,764 --> 00:44:04,724
and said he was losing weight.

546
00:44:06,444 --> 00:44:10,584
And I said I wasn't finding it easy
with the stitches

547
00:44:10,684 --> 00:44:12,984
and the worry
and losing so much sleep,

548
00:44:13,084 --> 00:44:16,664
and she said that she was here
for the baby and not me

549
00:44:16,764 --> 00:44:18,624
and that if he carried on
losing weight

550
00:44:18,724 --> 00:44:22,824
he's going to go back into hospital,
so I started to...cry

551
00:44:22,924 --> 00:44:27,404
and she started telling Rob
about her holidays.

552
00:44:29,044 --> 00:44:30,664
I wanted to scream at her.

553
00:44:30,764 --> 00:44:33,144
It is my first child,
you heartless bitch,

554
00:44:33,244 --> 00:44:35,124
I need a bit of help!

555
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:39,524
I had no-one.

556
00:44:41,284 --> 00:44:43,424
We'd moved there for Rob's job.

557
00:44:43,524 --> 00:44:46,684
He knew people in work.
I knew no-one.

558
00:44:48,404 --> 00:44:50,324
Just Rob and the baby.

559
00:44:59,244 --> 00:45:02,384
What time will you be back?
About eight.

560
00:45:02,484 --> 00:45:05,344
For God's sake, Rob.
We've got to have a debrief. No.

561
00:45:05,444 --> 00:45:07,424
You have a debrief
the next working day,

562
00:45:07,524 --> 00:45:09,104
you don't have a debrief
in your own time.

563
00:45:09,204 --> 00:45:11,384
We have to have it in our own time
cos we're snowed under.

564
00:45:11,484 --> 00:45:14,184
You're doing it after work
because you don't want to be here

565
00:45:14,284 --> 00:45:16,144
with the baby!
We're doing a debrief after work

566
00:45:16,244 --> 00:45:19,224
because it's the only time
we can do it. It's not fair, Rob.

567
00:45:19,324 --> 00:45:22,624
If I go out it's to get the shopping
and I'm back at six at the latest.

568
00:45:22,724 --> 00:45:25,904
I spend time with the baby -
with you AND the baby!

569
00:45:26,004 --> 00:45:29,604
And you are home at half eight
every time. Listen, I've got to go.

570
00:45:38,564 --> 00:45:40,043
Fuck off.

571
00:45:44,004 --> 00:45:47,224
Ssh... Ssh.

572
00:45:47,324 --> 00:45:50,544
Ssh-ssh-ssh!

573
00:45:50,644 --> 00:45:55,123
Ssh! Ssh.

574
00:45:57,244 --> 00:45:58,444
Ssh!

575
00:46:00,284 --> 00:46:03,544
One day I managed to get him
to sleep - God knows how -

576
00:46:03,644 --> 00:46:05,604
and I put him in his cot.

577
00:46:07,044 --> 00:46:09,984
I walked out the room,

578
00:46:10,084 --> 00:46:13,304
but once out the room

579
00:46:13,404 --> 00:46:15,684
I started thinking
I'd harmed him.

580
00:46:17,284 --> 00:46:19,084
I've killed him.

581
00:46:21,844 --> 00:46:25,744
I don't know why I thought that
but I did.

582
00:46:25,844 --> 00:46:28,884
So I went back in and checked
and he was fine.

583
00:46:30,404 --> 00:46:32,384
I walked out again.

584
00:46:32,484 --> 00:46:35,104
No sooner out the room then again
I'm thinking I've harmed him,

585
00:46:35,204 --> 00:46:38,144
so I go back again
and he's fine again.

586
00:46:38,244 --> 00:46:41,064
But this time
I can't leave him there

587
00:46:41,164 --> 00:46:43,824
so I pick him up and I carry him.

588
00:46:43,924 --> 00:46:46,984
And carry him and I carry him.

589
00:46:47,084 --> 00:46:48,904
And it's only when Rob comes home

590
00:46:49,004 --> 00:46:51,264
that I can put him down

591
00:46:51,364 --> 00:46:52,844
and leave him there.

592
00:46:54,404 --> 00:46:57,624
I couldn't let him out my sight.

593
00:46:57,724 --> 00:47:00,384
So every minute of every day,

594
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,784
I am looking at my child.

595
00:47:02,884 --> 00:47:06,724
Where other women are seeing
THEIR baby crying...

596
00:47:09,124 --> 00:47:12,744
..I'm looking at mine
and he's twisting.

597
00:47:12,844 --> 00:47:15,144
He's twisting in pain.

598
00:47:15,244 --> 00:47:18,624
He'd fight
even to get away from his dad.

599
00:47:18,724 --> 00:47:22,064
When he'd come back to me, crying.

600
00:47:22,164 --> 00:47:24,044
Still screaming.

601
00:47:26,044 --> 00:47:28,043
Nothing can make him stop.

602
00:47:30,084 --> 00:47:33,124
Yeah, Robert Cochrane.
He's in theatre.

603
00:47:35,844 --> 00:47:37,944
Well, yeah, I know that,
but when it is possible,

604
00:47:38,044 --> 00:47:40,704
could you ask him
to phone me, please?

605
00:47:40,804 --> 00:47:43,104
I'm his wife.

606
00:47:43,204 --> 00:47:46,084
Ssh-ssh-ssh-ssh.

607
00:47:50,364 --> 00:47:52,224
This is Croft Park Medical Centre.

608
00:47:52,324 --> 00:47:55,744
Our receptionists are busy
at the moment but you are...

609
00:47:55,844 --> 00:47:57,544
..18th in the queue.

610
00:47:57,644 --> 00:47:59,683
Please feel free...

611
00:48:20,284 --> 00:48:23,124
I think I wanted to stop him crying.

612
00:48:24,564 --> 00:48:26,364
It's just...

613
00:48:28,564 --> 00:48:33,564
If you...stop him crying
then you ease his pain.

614
00:48:35,924 --> 00:48:38,363
Just stop them crying.

615
00:49:09,324 --> 00:49:11,204
I held him under.

616
00:49:16,644 --> 00:49:18,764
I wanted peace and quiet.

617
00:49:21,444 --> 00:49:22,804
For him...

618
00:49:24,204 --> 00:49:25,644
..and for me.

619
00:49:27,484 --> 00:49:29,484
No more suffering.

620
00:51:05,644 --> 00:51:07,084
What's wrong?

621
00:51:09,044 --> 00:51:10,204
What is it?

622
00:51:13,084 --> 00:51:14,484
You didn't ring.

623
00:51:17,244 --> 00:51:18,964
My God, you're wet.

624
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:21,364
And cold.

625
00:51:23,164 --> 00:51:25,824
You're starting to scare me now,
Abs. What's wrong?

626
00:51:25,924 --> 00:51:27,404
Where's the baby?

627
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:31,844
Abi, where's the baby?

628
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:36,124
In his cot.

629
00:52:29,404 --> 00:52:31,924
Have you told this story
to anyone before?

630
00:52:34,844 --> 00:52:36,964
It wouldn't bring him back.

631
00:52:39,084 --> 00:52:42,524
No. But it...could've helped you.

632
00:52:45,404 --> 00:52:47,764
I was under pressure, yeah.

633
00:52:49,284 --> 00:52:50,764
But so...

634
00:52:53,644 --> 00:52:55,764
..were so many other women.

635
00:52:58,764 --> 00:53:00,344
They coped.

636
00:53:00,444 --> 00:53:02,384
I didn't.

637
00:53:02,484 --> 00:53:07,184
I was... Yeah, I was ashamed,
I was ashamed of that.

638
00:53:07,284 --> 00:53:09,984
Didn't want them to know that.

639
00:53:10,084 --> 00:53:13,524
So I told all about killing my baby.

640
00:53:15,604 --> 00:53:19,084
But I told no-one
that I couldn't cope.

641
00:53:22,484 --> 00:53:24,684
Can I ask a question?

642
00:53:26,484 --> 00:53:27,684
Yeah.

643
00:53:30,764 --> 00:53:32,164
What was his name?

644
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:44,524
Daniel.

645
00:53:51,604 --> 00:53:52,924
Daniel.

646
00:54:05,044 --> 00:54:07,584
One of them will go for me now.

647
00:54:07,684 --> 00:54:10,104
Someone from the group? Mm-hm.

648
00:54:10,204 --> 00:54:13,544
Yeah. I've shown a bit
of vulnerability, you see.

649
00:54:13,644 --> 00:54:16,864
They'll think I'm not so tough,
they can take me on and win.

650
00:54:16,964 --> 00:54:19,824
Other women have spoken
and nothing's happened.

651
00:54:19,924 --> 00:54:22,084
They haven't murdered their kids.

652
00:54:23,484 --> 00:54:26,024
Shall we sit? If you want.

653
00:54:26,124 --> 00:54:27,444
Yes, I do.

654
00:54:34,844 --> 00:54:38,064
She cared for me all the way through
my pregnancy. All the way.

655
00:54:38,164 --> 00:54:41,064
And she, like, delivered my...
She delivered my little Daniel.

656
00:54:41,164 --> 00:54:43,424
She delivered your baby,
that entitles her to murder her own?

657
00:54:43,524 --> 00:54:45,544
That's what you're saying?
That's not what I'm saying.

658
00:54:45,644 --> 00:54:46,864
I'm saying she's done a bit of good.

659
00:54:46,964 --> 00:54:49,744
She's done way more good than anyone
else in here, including me. Yeah.

660
00:54:49,844 --> 00:54:52,704
I mean, she could have walked away,
she didn't have to help Kelsey.

661
00:54:52,804 --> 00:54:55,664
She's a trained nurse. I know, but
she didn't have to help, did she?

662
00:54:55,764 --> 00:54:58,684
You can't deny
that she's done something.

663
00:55:05,444 --> 00:55:07,664
What does that represent?

664
00:55:07,764 --> 00:55:10,364
What do you want it to represent?

665
00:55:11,764 --> 00:55:15,864
Is it my child, still alive,
up in heaven?

666
00:55:15,964 --> 00:55:17,644
Perhaps. It's a candle.

667
00:55:19,044 --> 00:55:21,144
It's a bloody candle.

668
00:55:21,244 --> 00:55:24,784
You want me to blow it out?
Do you want it lit? Yes.

669
00:55:24,884 --> 00:55:29,304
It reminds me
of the presence of Christ.

670
00:55:29,404 --> 00:55:30,804
Fine.

671
00:55:34,444 --> 00:55:37,164
I ask a lot of women this,
do you mind?

672
00:55:39,324 --> 00:55:42,784
If I could grant you one wish,
what would that be?

673
00:55:42,884 --> 00:55:45,584
I fear I'll say what they all say -

674
00:55:45,684 --> 00:55:48,504
can I go back in time, please?

675
00:55:48,604 --> 00:55:50,324
A lot say that, yes.

676
00:55:52,044 --> 00:55:56,764
So, if I could grant you
another wish, what would that be?

677
00:55:58,684 --> 00:56:01,664
Has the bishop found you out yet?

678
00:56:01,764 --> 00:56:03,784
No.

679
00:56:03,884 --> 00:56:05,164
Good.

680
00:56:10,524 --> 00:56:15,404
So if I could grant you another
wish, what would that be?

681
00:56:22,844 --> 00:56:25,044
I'd like to be able to grieve.

682
00:56:28,484 --> 00:56:30,984
But how do you grieve
the death of a child

683
00:56:31,084 --> 00:56:33,244
when you're the one responsible
for it?

684
00:56:34,524 --> 00:56:37,004
Can I pray for that?

685
00:56:38,924 --> 00:56:42,124
That God enables you
to grieve for Daniel?

686
00:56:48,084 --> 00:56:49,124
Yes.

687
00:56:53,844 --> 00:56:57,024
OK, what if we'd done it?
What if we killed our babies?

688
00:56:57,124 --> 00:57:00,264
I wouldn't. Yeah,
but what if we had? We'd be wrecks.

689
00:57:00,364 --> 00:57:03,104
That woman is a wreck and she
deserves a bit of compassion.

690
00:57:03,204 --> 00:57:05,064
She needs looking after,

691
00:57:05,164 --> 00:57:07,184
not attacking.
I think we're all forgetting

692
00:57:07,284 --> 00:57:09,144
she couldn't kill herself.

693
00:57:09,244 --> 00:57:13,224
OK to kill a baby but not herself?
No, that is a selfish bitch.

694
00:57:13,324 --> 00:57:16,024
That's not what I'm saying.
Maeve, what do you think?

695
00:57:16,124 --> 00:57:19,224
What Abi said stuck with me when she
said that we need to show the world

696
00:57:19,324 --> 00:57:22,224
that we couldn't possibly
do what she did, so we attack,

697
00:57:22,324 --> 00:57:25,504
and the more we attack,
the more we feel saintly.

698
00:57:25,604 --> 00:57:27,324
And that's fucking bullshit.

699
00:58:24,484 --> 00:58:26,684
My God, the telly's off.

700
00:58:30,364 --> 00:58:32,184
Yeah, we've been talking.

701
00:58:32,284 --> 00:58:33,804
About me. Yeah.

702
00:58:35,284 --> 00:58:38,124
Look, no-one here's going to
do you any harm.

703
00:58:39,484 --> 00:58:42,964
OK, I'm not saying that everyone
forgives you. They don't. But...

704
00:58:44,004 --> 00:58:46,064
..we won't do you harm.

705
00:58:46,164 --> 00:58:48,744
I can't speak
for the rest of the prison,

706
00:58:48,844 --> 00:58:51,704
they'll need putting straight,
but everyone here right now,

707
00:58:51,804 --> 00:58:54,504
everyone in this unit, right?

708
00:58:54,604 --> 00:58:56,324
Yeah. Yeah.

709
00:58:57,364 --> 00:58:59,084
You're fine.

710
00:59:07,404 --> 00:59:09,524
What, including you?

711
00:59:10,924 --> 00:59:12,024
Yeah.

712
00:59:12,124 --> 00:59:13,824
Whatever.

713
00:59:13,924 --> 00:59:15,004
Yeah.

714
00:59:22,484 --> 00:59:24,004
Thank you.

715
00:59:28,124 --> 00:59:29,364
Thanks.

716
01:00:38,044 --> 01:00:39,964
Bye, then.

717
01:00:43,924 --> 01:00:45,404
Bye.

718
01:00:52,084 --> 01:00:54,464
No ta-ras, then.

719
01:00:54,564 --> 01:00:56,084
Looks like that.

720
01:00:57,804 --> 01:00:59,484
I'll come with you.

721
01:02:48,204 --> 01:02:49,764
You OK? Yeah.

722
01:03:20,124 --> 01:03:23,024
Mrs Kelly? I'm Fay Clarkson
from Children and Families.

723
01:03:23,124 --> 01:03:26,924
We spoke on the phone. Hello.
This is Kelsey. Hi. Hi, Kelsey.

724
01:03:29,844 --> 01:03:32,004
Give Mummy a big hug, Daniel.

725
01:03:42,764 --> 01:03:45,344
He'll be yours again soon, my love.

726
01:03:45,444 --> 01:03:47,424
Just keep doing what you're doing.

727
01:03:47,524 --> 01:03:50,364
I will. I will, I will.
