1
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,720
Well, my dad was a farmer.

2
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,520
Like everybody else back then.

3
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,360
Of course, he didn't start that way.

4
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,720
<i>Computer says you're too tight.</i>

5
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,400
Nah, I got this.

6
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,000
<i>Crossing the Straights.</i>

7
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,120
- <i>Shutting it down, Cooper.</i>
- No!

8
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,440
<i>Shutting it all down.</i>

9
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,840
No, I need power up!

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Dad?

11
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,680
Sorry, Murph. Go back to bed.

12
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,440
- I thought you were the ghost.
- No.

13
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,120
There are no such things
as ghosts, babe.

14
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,000
Grandpa says you can get ghosts.

15
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,880
Maybe that's because Grandpa's close
to being one himself. Back to bed.

16
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,120
Were you dreaming about the crash?

17
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,520
Get your butt back in bed, Murph.

18
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,120
The wheat had died.

19
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,880
The blight came
and we had to burn it.

20
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,640
And we still had corn.
We had acres of corn.

21
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,840
But mostly we had dust.

22
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,920
I guess I can't describe it.
It was just constant.

23
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,320
Just that steady blow of dirt.

24
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,520
We wore little strips of sheet

25
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,320
sometimes over our nose and mouth

26
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,640
so that we wouldn't
breathe so much of it.

27
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,000
When we set the table

28
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,040
we always set the plate upside-down.

29
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,760
Glasses or cups,
whatever it was upside-down.

30
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,360
- Shake a leg! Murph, get a move on!
- Tom, four o'clock today

31
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,000
you and me in the barn,
Herbicide Resistance 101.

32
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,320
- Check?
- Yes, sir.

33
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,240
Not at the table, Murph.

34
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,880
Dad, can you fix this?

35
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,096
What the heck did you do
to my lander?

36
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,120
Wasn't me.

37
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,240
Let me guess. It was your ghost?

38
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,600
It knocked it off my shelf.
It keeps knocking books off.

39
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,040
No such thing as ghosts, dumb-ass.

40
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,440
- Hey.
- I looked it up.

41
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,560
It's called a poltergeist.

42
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,640
Dad, tell her.

43
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,040
Well, it's not
very scientific, Murph.

44
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,320
You said science was about
admitting what we don't know.

45
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,560
She's got you there.

46
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,000
Hey. Start looking after our stuff.

47
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,560
Coop.

48
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,440
All right, Murph,
you want to talk science?

49
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,416
Don't just tell me that
you're afraid of some ghost.

50
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,600
No, you got to go further.

51
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,480
You gotta record the facts, analyze,
get to the how and the why

52
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,480
then present your conclusions. Deal?

53
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,680
- Deal.
- All right.

54
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,200
- Have a good day at school.
- Hold up.

55
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,000
Parent-teacher conferences. Parent.

56
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,560
Not grandparent.

57
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,560
Slow down, turbo!

58
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,280
That's not a dust storm.

59
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,320
Nelson's torching his whole crop.

60
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,480
Blight?

61
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,760
They're saying
it's the last harvest for okra.

62
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,840
Ever.

63
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,120
He should've planted corn
like the rest of us.

64
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,120
Now, you be nice
to that Miss Hanley. She's single.

65
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,400
What's that supposed to mean?

66
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,000
Repopulating the earth.

67
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,600
Start pulling your weight, young man.

68
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,800
Why don't you start
minding your own business, old man?

69
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,040
All right, Murph, give me second.

70
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,920
Third.

71
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,680
Find a gear, dumb-ass.

72
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,280
- Grind it!
- Shut it, Tom!

73
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,640
What'd you do, Murph?

74
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,560
She didn't do nothing.
Blew a tire is all.

75
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,640
Murphy's Law.

76
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,160
Shut up!

77
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,240
Grab the spare, Tom.

78
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,320
That is the spare.

79
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,000
Get the patch kit.

80
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,936
How am I supposed
to patch it out here?

81
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,320
You gotta figure it out.

82
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,280
I'm not always gonna
be here to help you.

83
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,320
What's going on, Murph?

84
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,200
Why did you and Mom name me
after something that's bad?

85
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,760
We didn't.

86
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,640
Murphy's Law?

87
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,800
Murphy's Law doesn't mean
that something bad will happen.

88
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,120
What it means is
whatever can happen will happen.

89
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,160
And that sounded just fine with us.

90
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,040
Get in.

91
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,480
Get in, let's go.

92
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,000
What about the flat tire?

93
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,920
Yeah.

94
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,160
It's an Indian Air Force drone.

95
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,400
Solar cells could
power an entire farm.

96
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,560
Take the wheel, Tom.

97
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,200
Go, go, go!

98
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,480
Keep that aimed right at it.

99
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,240
Faster, Tom. I'm losing it.

100
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,360
Right at it.

101
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,080
Stay on it.

102
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,600
Here we go.

103
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,200
Nice one, Tom.

104
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,040
Dad?

105
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,880
I almost got it. Don't stop...

106
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,640
Dad!

107
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,880
Tom!

108
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,320
You told me to keep driving.

109
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,560
I guess that answers

110
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,360
the old "if I asked you
to drive off a cliff" scenario.

111
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,240
- We lost it.
- No, we didn't.

112
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,120
Want to give it a whirl?

113
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,120
This way.

114
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,560
Go.

115
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,440
Let's lay her down right there
at the edge of the reservoir.

116
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,960
Nicely done.

117
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,800
How long you think
it's been up there?

118
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,400
Delhi Mission Control went down,
same as ours

119
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,560
ten years ago.

120
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,080
So for ten years?

121
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,640
Why did it come down so low?

122
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,760
I don't know.

123
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,000
Maybe the sun cooked its brain
or it was looking for something.

124
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,160
- What?
- Give me a large flatblade.

125
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,200
Maybe some kind of signal?
I don't know.

126
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,640
What are you gonna do with it?

127
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,120
I'm gonna give it something
socially responsible to do...

128
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,760
like drive a combine.

129
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,600
Can't we just let it go?

130
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,320
It wasn't hurting anybody.

131
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,120
This thing needs to learn
how to adapt, Murph

132
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,000
like the rest of us.

133
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,480
How's this work? You guys come with?

134
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,600
I've got class.

135
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,880
This one needs to wait.

136
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,640
What did you do?

137
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,296
They'll tell you about it
when you get in there.

138
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,320
- What, am I gonna be mad?
- Not with me.

139
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,240
- Just please try not to.
- Hey. Relax.

140
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I got this.

141
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,600
Little late, Coop.

142
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,200
Yeah, we had a flat.

143
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,920
And I guess you had to stop off
at the Asian fighter plane store.

144
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,480
No, actually, sir, that's a...
that's a surveillance drone.

145
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,000
With outstanding solar cells.
It's Indian.

146
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,720
Take a seat.

147
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,360
So...

148
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,200
we got Tom's scores back.

149
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,120
He's gonna make an excellent farmer.

150
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,200
Yeah, he's got a knack for it.
What about college?

151
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,080
Well, the university
only takes a handful.

152
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,576
They don't really have
the resources to...

153
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,040
I still pay my taxes.

154
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,160
Where's that money go?
There's no more armies.

155
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,160
Well, it doesn't go
to the university.

156
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,800
Look, Coop, you have to be realistic.

157
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,120
You're ruling my son
out for college now?

158
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,040
The kid's 15.

159
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,520
Tom's score simply isn't high enough.

160
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,480
What's your waistline?

161
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,680
About what, 32?

162
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,400
About a 33 inseam?

163
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,136
I'm not sure I see
what you're getting at.

164
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,376
Are you tellin' me
it takes two numbers

165
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,600
to measure your own ass

166
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,720
but only one to measure
my son's future?

167
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,560
Come on.

168
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,440
You're a well-educated man, Coop.

169
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,480
- And a trained pilot.
- And an engineer.

170
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,120
Okay, well, right now
we don't need more engineers.

171
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,640
We didn't run out of
television screens and planes.

172
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,880
We ran out of food.

173
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,600
The world needs farmers.
Good farmers, like you.

174
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,760
- And Tom.
- Uneducated farmers.

175
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,720
We're a caretaker generation, Coop.
And things are getting better.

176
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,520
Maybe your grandkids
will get to be engin...

177
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,560
Are we done here, sir?

178
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,200
No.

179
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,000
Miss Hanley's here
to talk about Murph.

180
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,880
Murph is a great kid.
She's really bright.

181
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,576
But she's been having
a little trouble lately.

182
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,920
She brought this in
to show the other students.

183
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,520
The section on the lunar landings.

184
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,720
Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks.

185
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,480
She always loved the pictures.

186
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,720
It's an old federal textbook.

187
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,800
We've replaced them
with the corrected versions.

188
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,400
Corrected?

189
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,520
Explaining how
the Apollo missions were faked

190
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,200
to bankrupt the Soviet Union.

191
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,800
You don't believe
we went to the moon?

192
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,840
I believe it was
a brilliant piece of propaganda.

193
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,720
That the Soviets
bankrupted themselves

194
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,800
pouring resources into rockets
and other useless machines.

195
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,200
"Useless machines."

196
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,960
And if we don't want
a repeat of the excess

197
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,800
and wastefulness of the 20th century

198
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,720
then we need to teach our kids about
this planet, not tales of leaving it.

199
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,320
Yeah, one of those useless machines
they used to make was called an MRI.

200
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,800
And if we had any of those left

201
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,136
the doctors would've
been able to find

202
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,880
the cyst in my wife's brain

203
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,120
before she died
instead of afterwards.

204
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,656
And then she'd have been
the one sitting here

205
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,280
listening to this instead of me

206
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,920
which would have been a good thing,
because she was always the...

207
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,040
the calmer one.

208
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,560
I'm sorry about your wife,
Mr. Cooper.

209
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,160
But Murph got into a fistfight
with several of her classmates

210
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,200
over this Apollo nonsense.

211
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,856
So we thought it would be best
to bring you in and see what ideas

212
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,336
you might have for dealing
with her behavior on the home front.

213
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,360
All right.

214
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,160
Yeah, you know what?

215
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,880
There's a game tomorrow night.

216
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,000
She's going through
a bit of a baseball phase.

217
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,360
Her favorite team is playing.

218
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,800
There's gonna be
candy and soda and...

219
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,760
I think I'll take her to that.

220
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
How'd it go?

221
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,720
I got you suspended.

222
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,400
- What?
- <i>Cooper.</i>

223
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,160
This is Cooper. Go.

224
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,080
<i>Coop, those combines you rebuilt
went haywire.</i>

225
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,240
Just reset the controllers.

226
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,800
<i>I did that.
Now you should come take a look.</i>

227
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,920
One by one they've been peeling off
the fields and heading over.

228
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,120
Something's interfering
with the compass.

229
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,440
Magnetism or some such.

230
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,120
Nothing special about which book.

231
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,000
I've been working on it,
like you said.

232
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,200
I counted the spaces.

233
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,520
Why?

234
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,080
In case the ghost is trying
to communicate.

235
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,360
I'm trying Morse.

236
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,200
Morse?

237
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,800
Yeah.

238
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,320
Dots and dashes, used...

239
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,840
I know what Morse code is, Murph.

240
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,320
I just don't think your bookshelf's
trying to talk to you.

241
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,800
Had to reset every compass clock
and GPS to offset for the anomaly.

242
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,360
Which is?

243
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,560
I don't know.

244
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,520
I mean, if the house was built
on magnetic ore

245
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,040
we'd have seen this the first time
we switched on the tractor.

246
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,800
I hear your meeting at the school
didn't go so well.

247
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,640
You heard?

248
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,800
It's like we've forgotten
who we are, Donald.

249
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,880
Explorers, pioneers, not caretakers.

250
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,120
When I was a kid

251
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,120
it felt like they made
something new every day.

252
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:28,000
Some gadget or idea.
Like every day was Christmas.

253
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,920
But six billion people
just try to imagine that.

254
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,720
And every last one of them
trying to have it all.

255
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,800
This world isn't so bad.

256
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,040
And Tom will do just fine.

257
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,840
You're the one who doesn't belong.

258
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,920
Born 40 years too late,
or 40 years too early.

259
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,720
My daughter knew it, God bless her.

260
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,320
And your kids know it.
Especially Murph.

261
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,720
Well, we used to look up
in the sky and wonder

262
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,400
at our place in the stars.

263
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,280
Now we just look down and
worry about our place in the dirt.

264
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,000
Cooper, you were good at something

265
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,120
and you never got a chance
to do anything with it.

266
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,880
I'm sorry.

267
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,720
You didn't expect this dirt
that was giving you this food

268
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,960
to turn on you like that
and destroy you.

269
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,640
In April... I believe I'm right...
15th of April, I think.

270
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,800
This... 'cause this happened
about 1.30pm when that thing came off

271
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,200
the top of that canyon.

272
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,720
In my day, we had real ballplayers.

273
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,320
Who are these bums?

274
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,920
Yeah, well, in my day,
people were too busy

275
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,920
fighting over food
to even play baseball.

276
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,200
Popcorn at a ballgame is unnatural.

277
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,200
I want a hot dog.

278
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,320
School says you're gonna follow
in my footsteps.

279
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,520
I think that's great.

280
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,360
You think that's great?

281
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,920
You hate farming, Dad.

282
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Grandpa said.

283
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,760
Grandpa said, huh?

284
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,640
Listen, all that matters
is how you feel about it.

285
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,400
I like what you do.

286
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,520
I like our farm.

287
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,760
You're gonna be great at it.

288
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,560
Let's get out of here.

289
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,400
All right, it's a doozy.

290
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,800
All right, gang, let's mask up.

291
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,160
- Tom? Murph? Check?
- Yeah.

292
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,680
Murph, Tom,
you guys shut your windows?

293
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,080
Murph?

294
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,840
The ghost.

295
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,320
Grab your pillow.

296
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,680
You're sleeping in with Tom.

297
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,120
It's not a ghost.

298
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,680
It's gravity.

299
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,880
I'm dropping Tom,
then heading to town.

300
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,600
You want to clean that up

301
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,080
when you've finished praying to it?

302
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,240
It's not Morse, Murph. It's binary.

303
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,760
Thick is one, thin is zero.

304
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,640
Coordinates.

305
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,360
Nope.

306
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,320
Here we go.

307
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,000
33.

308
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,960
That's it.

309
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,560
I can't miss this.

310
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,056
- Come on!
- Grandpa will be back

311
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,560
in a couple hours, Murph.

312
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,720
But you don't know
what you're gonna find.

313
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,280
And that...

314
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,200
is why I can't take you.

315
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,400
Murph?

316
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,400
Grandpa will be home in a while.
Tell him I'll call him on the radio.

317
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,240
Jesus.

318
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
What are you doing?

319
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,200
You think this is funny? Huh?

320
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,000
You wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for me.

321
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,800
Make yourself useful.

322
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,040
Hey, Murph?

323
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,760
Murph.

324
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,880
I think this is the end of the road.

325
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,000
Didn't you bring the bolt cutters?

326
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,640
That's my girl.

327
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,560
- Step away from the fence!
- No...

328
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,200
Don't shoot...! I'm not armed.

329
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,640
My daughter's in the car.

330
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,200
Don't be afraid.

331
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,720
How did you find this place?

332
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,080
Where's my daughter?

333
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,960
You had the coordinates for
this facility marked on your map.

334
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,256
Where did you get those coordinates?

335
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,480
Where's my daughter?

336
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,856
Don't make me take you down again.

337
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,000
Sit down!

338
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,000
You still think you're a Marine, pal?

339
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,200
Marines don't exist anymore.

340
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,120
And I got grunts like you
mowing my grass.

341
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,680
Where did you find those coordinates?

342
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,880
Yeah, but you don't look
much like a lawnmower.

343
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,240
Think I'll turn you into
an overqualified vacuum cleaner.

344
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,320
No, you won't.

345
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,920
TARS, back down, please.

346
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,680
You know, you're taking a risk
using ex-military security.

347
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,520
They're old, and their control units
are unpredictable.

348
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,360
It's what the government could spare.

349
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,200
Who are you?

350
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,680
Dr. Brand.

351
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,920
I knew a Dr. Brand once.
He was a professor.

352
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,200
What makes you think I'm not?

353
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,560
Wasn't near as cute, either.

354
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,680
Please, Dr. Brand.
I don't have any idea what this is.

355
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,920
Now I'm scared for my daughter
and I want her by my side.

356
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,320
You give me that, I'll tell you
anything you want to know.

357
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,240
Get the principals and the girl
in the conference room, please.

358
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,080
Your daughter is fine.

359
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,720
Bright kid.

360
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,720
Must have a very smart mother.

361
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,360
It's pretty clear
you don't want any visitors.

362
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,136
So why don't you just let us
back up from your fence

363
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,320
and we'll be on our way, huh?

364
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,600
It's not that simple.

365
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,120
Well, sure, it is.

366
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,536
I don't know anything about you.

367
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,360
I don't know anything
about this place.

368
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,600
Yes, you do.

369
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,200
Dad!

370
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,120
Hello, Cooper.

371
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,400
Professor Brand.

372
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,120
Explain to me
how you found this facility.

373
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,536
Kind of an accident. We sort of

374
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,240
stumbled upon it.
We were on a salvage run

375
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,376
- we came across the fence...
- You're sitting in

376
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,280
the best-kept secret in the world.

377
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,560
Nobody stumbles in here.
Nobody stumbles out.

378
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,760
Cooper, please.

379
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,760
Cooperate with these people.

380
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
Look.

381
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,880
It's kinda hard to explain.

382
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,080
Now, we... we learned
these coordinates from an anomaly.

383
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,200
What sort of anomaly?

384
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,560
I hesitate to term it supernatural,
but it definitely wasn't scientific.

385
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,480
- Usually...
- You're gonna have to be specific

386
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,560
Mr. Cooper. Right now.

387
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,680
It was gravity.

388
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,480
- What sort of gravitational anomaly?
- No

389
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,640
- Where was this?
- No, hey.

390
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,200
Now, I'm real happy that
you're excited about gravity, bud

391
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,640
but you're not getting any answers
from us until I get assurances.

392
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,240
- Assurances?
- Yeah.

393
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,800
Like that we're getting out of here.

394
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,720
And I don't mean
in the trunk of some car.

395
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,800
Don't you know who we are, Coop?

396
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,320
No, Professor, I don't.

397
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,200
You know my father, Professor Brand.

398
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,080
We're NASA.

399
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,000
NASA?

400
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,080
NASA.

401
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,520
The same NASA you flew for.

402
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,200
I heard they shut you down, sir,
for refusing to drop bombs

403
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,320
from the stratosphere
onto starving people.

404
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,760
When they realized
that killing other people was

405
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,760
not a long-term solution,
then they needed us back.

406
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,680
- In secret.
- Why secret?

407
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,720
Because public opinion wouldn't
allow spending on space exploration.

408
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,200
Not while you're struggling
to put food on the table.

409
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,520
Blight.

410
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:31,000
Wheat seven years ago.
Okra this year.

411
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,920
Now there's just corn.

412
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,280
And we're growing
more than we ever have.

413
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,200
But like the potatoes in Ireland
and the wheat in the Dust Bowl

414
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,200
the corn will die.

415
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,160
Soon.

416
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,560
We'll find a way, professor.
We always have.

417
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,120
Driven by the unshakable faith
the Earth is ours.

418
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,360
Not just ours, no.

419
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,600
But it is our home.

420
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,200
Earth's atmosphere is 80% nitrogen.

421
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,920
We don't even breathe nitrogen.

422
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:12,880
Blight does. And as it thrives,
our air gets less and less oxygen.

423
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,640
The last people to starve
will be the first to suffocate.

424
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,840
And your daughter's generation...

425
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,360
will be the last to survive on Earth.

426
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,280
Murph is feeling a little tired.

427
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,520
I was wondering
if she could take a nap in my office.

428
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,000
Yeah. Thank you.

429
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,840
Okay

430
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,800
now you need to tell me
what your plan is to save the world.

431
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,200
We're not meant to save the world.
We're meant to leave it.

432
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,880
Rangers.

433
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,840
The last components of
our one versatile ship in orbit

434
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,920
the Endurance.

435
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,640
Our final expedition.

436
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,720
You sent people out there
looking for a new home?

437
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,080
The Lazarus missions.

438
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,440
Oh, that sounds cheerful.

439
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,280
Lazarus came back from the dead.

440
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,920
Sure, but he had to die
in the first place.

441
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,800
There's not a planet
in our solar system

442
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,960
that could sustain life

443
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,320
and the nearest star's
over a thousand years away.

444
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,600
I mean, that doesn't
even qualify as futile.

445
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,800
Where'd you send them?

446
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,240
Cooper

447
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:22,000
I can't tell you anymore
unless you agree to pilot this craft.

448
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,920
You're the best pilot we ever had.

449
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,680
Yeah, and I barely
left the stratosphere.

450
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,960
This team never left the simulator.

451
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,240
We need a pilot

452
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,800
and this is the mission
that you were trained for.

453
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,520
Without even knowing it?

454
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,400
An hour ago, you didn't even know
I was alive. You were going anyway.

455
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,040
We had no choice.

456
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,320
But something sent you here.

457
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,680
They chose you.

458
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,080
Who's "they"?

459
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,160
How long would I be gone?

460
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,360
Hard to know.

461
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Years?

462
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,160
I've got kids, Professor.

463
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,200
Get out there and save them.

464
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,200
Who's "they"?

465
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,440
We started detecting gravitational
anomalies almost 50 years ago.

466
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,720
Mostly small distortions

467
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,600
to our instruments
in the upper atmosphere.

468
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,000
In fact, I believe
you encountered one yourself.

469
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,360
Yeah, over the Straights.

470
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,440
My crash. Something tripped
my fly-by-wire.

471
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,560
Exactly.

472
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,200
But of all these anomalies,
the most significant is this:

473
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,920
Out near Saturn

474
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,320
a disturbance of space-time.

475
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,560
Is that a wormhole?

476
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,560
It appeared 48 years ago.

477
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,080
And it leads where?

478
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,680
Another galaxy.

479
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,840
A wormhole's not
a naturally occurring phenomenon.

480
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,200
Someone placed it there.

481
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
"They"?

482
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,600
And whoever they are,
they appear to be looking out for us.

483
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,160
That wormhole lets us
travel to other stars.

484
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,680
It came along right as we needed it.

485
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,880
They've put potentially habitable
worlds right within our reach.

486
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,160
12, in fact,
from our initial probes.

487
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,560
You sent probes into that?

488
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,520
We sent people into it.
Ten years ago.

489
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,920
The Lazarus missions.

490
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,640
12 possible worlds

491
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,360
12 Ranger launches carrying

492
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,720
the bravest humans ever to live

493
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,560
led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.

494
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,920
Each person's landing pod had
enough life support for two years.

495
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,776
But they could use hibernation
to stretch that

496
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:33,000
making observations on organics
over a decade or more.

497
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,280
Their mission was
to assess their world

498
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,680
and if it showed potential

499
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,000
then they could send out a signal,
bed down for the long nap

500
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,360
wait to be rescued.

501
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,480
And what if the world
didn't show promise?

502
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,520
Hence the bravery.

503
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,720
You don't have the resources
to visit all 12.

504
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
No.

505
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,600
Data transmission back through
the wormhole is rudimentary.

506
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,520
Simple binary pings
on an annual basis give us some clue

507
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,520
as to which worlds have potential.

508
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,520
And one system shows promise.

509
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,000
Yeah, one. That's a bit
of a long shot, isn't it?

510
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,480
One system
with three potential worlds?

511
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,240
No long shot.

512
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,720
Okay.

513
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,200
So if we find a home...

514
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,360
then what?

515
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,320
That's the long shot.

516
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,640
There's a Plan A and a Plan B.

517
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,400
Did you notice anything strange
about the launch chamber?

518
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,200
This entire facility's a centrifuge.

519
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,200
Some kind of vehicle.
A space station?

520
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,000
Both. Plan A.

521
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,720
How do you get it off the ground?

522
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,080
The first gravitational anomalies
changed everything.

523
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:56,200
Suddenly we knew
that harnessing gravity was real.

524
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,120
So I started working on a theory
and we started building this station.

525
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,320
But you haven't solved it yet.

526
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,000
That's why there's Plan B.

527
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,160
The problem is gravity.

528
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,400
How to get a viable amount
of human life off the planet.

529
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,480
This is one way.

530
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,760
Plan B: a population bomb.

531
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,680
Over 5,000 fertilized eggs
weighing in at just under 900 kilos.

532
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,920
How would you raise them?

533
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,760
With equipment on board,
we incubate the first ten.

534
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,320
After that, with surrogacy,
the growth becomes exponential.

535
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,200
Within 30 years,
we could have a colony of hundreds.

536
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,840
The real difficulty with colonization
is genetic diversity.

537
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,520
This takes care of that.

538
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,080
Yeah, but what about
the people here? You just...

539
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,080
you give up on them?

540
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,640
My kids?

541
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,240
That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.

542
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,200
How far have you got?

543
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,520
Almost there.

544
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,680
You're asking me to hang everything

545
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,200
on an almost.

546
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,800
I'm asking you to trust me.

547
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,480
Find us a new home.

548
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,880
And by the time you return

549
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,040
I will have solved
the problem of gravity.

550
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,680
I give you my word.

551
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,880
Go away!

552
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,600
Murph.

553
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,480
Go! If you're leaving, just go.

554
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,880
This world was never enough
for you, was it, Coop?

555
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,360
What, because heading out there
is what I feel like I was born to do?

556
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,720
And it excites me?

557
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,160
No, that does not make it wrong.

558
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,440
It might.

559
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,560
Don't trust the right thing
done for the wrong reason.

560
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,920
The why of the thing,
that's the foundation.

561
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,760
And the foundation's solid.

562
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,560
We farmers, we sit here every year
when the rains fail and we say:

563
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,280
"Next year."

564
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,320
Well, next year ain't gonna save us,
nor the one after that.

565
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,400
This world's a treasure, Donald

566
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,920
but it's been telling us
to leave for a while now.

567
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,120
Mankind was born on Earth,
it was never meant to die here.

568
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,560
Tom will be all right, but you got
to make things right with Murph.

569
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,680
I will.

570
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,320
Without making promises
you don't know you can keep.

571
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,520
You have to talk to me, Murph.

572
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,120
I need to fix this before I go.

573
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,560
Then I'll keep it broken
so you have to stay.

574
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,280
After you kids came along

575
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,520
your mom, she said something to me
I never quite understood.

576
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,080
She said, "Now...

577
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:17,200
we're just here
to be memories for our kids."

578
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,520
And I think that
now I understand what she meant.

579
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,760
Once you're a parent, you're
the ghost of your children's future.

580
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,240
You said ghosts didn't exist.

581
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,040
That's right, Murph.

582
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,360
Murph, look at me.

583
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,680
I can't be your ghost right now.

584
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,200
I need to exist.

585
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,720
They chose me.

586
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,200
Murph, they chose me. You saw.
You're the one who led me to them.

587
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,040
That's exactly why you can't go.

588
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,920
I figured out the message.

589
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,960
One word. Know what it is?

590
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,200
- Murph.
- "Stay."

591
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,720
It says, "Stay," Dad.

592
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,800
Murph.

593
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,680
You don't believe me.

594
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,600
Look at the books! Look at this.
It says, "Stay."

595
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,800
Why... You're not listening!
It says, "Stay!"

596
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,400
No, I'm coming back.

597
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,920
When?

598
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,000
One for you, one for me.

599
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,200
When I'm up there
in hypersleep, or...

600
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,680
or traveling
near the speed of light, or...

601
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,720
near a black hole...

602
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,400
time's gonna change for me.

603
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,880
And it's gonna run more slowly.

604
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,160
Now

605
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,000
when we get back...

606
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,800
we're gonna compare.

607
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,200
- Time will run differently for us?
- Yeah.

608
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,800
By the time I get back, we might
even be the same age, you and me.

609
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,320
"What?"

610
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,680
Imagine that!

611
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,960
Aw, Murph...

612
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,320
You have no idea
when you're coming back.

613
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,560
No idea at all!

614
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,000
Murph, don't...
Don't make me leave like this.

615
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,200
Come on, Murph!

616
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,800
Don't make me leave like this, Murph!

617
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,680
Hey...

618
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,120
I love you.

619
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,160
Forever. You hear me?

620
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,720
I love you forever,
and I'm coming back.

621
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,640
I'm coming back.

622
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,400
How'd it go?

623
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,720
It went fine.

624
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,840
Just fine.

625
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,960
I love you, Tom.

626
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,920
- Travel safe, huh?
- Yeah.

627
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,920
You look after our place
for me, all right?

628
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,600
All right?

629
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,416
Hey, can I use your truck
while you're gone?

630
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,680
You mean your truck?

631
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,800
I'll make sure they bring it back.

632
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,400
Look after my kids, Donald!

633
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:08,320
Go for main engine start.
T-minus 10...

634
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,800
- Dad!
- Nine...

635
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,880
Dad!

636
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,880
Eight...

637
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,240
seven...

638
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,320
Dad!

639
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,800
Six...

640
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,960
five, main engine start, four...

641
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,200
three...

642
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
two...

643
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,880
one. Booster ignition and...

644
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,120
All engines look good.
Beginning roll program.

645
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,760
Prepare for stage one separation.

646
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,280
Stage one.

647
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,480
There is Mach One.

648
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,920
Everybody good?
Plenty of slaves for my robot colony?

649
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,000
They gave him a humor setting
so he'd fit in better with his unit.

650
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,160
He thinks it relaxes us.

651
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,720
A giant sarcastic robot.

652
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,200
What a great idea!

653
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,880
I have a cue light I can use
when I'm joking if you like.

654
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,000
That'd probably help.

655
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,936
Yeah, you can use it
to find your way back to the ship

656
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,360
after I blow you out the airlock.

657
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,520
What's your humor setting, TARS?

658
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,920
That's 100%.

659
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,800
Let's bring it on down to 75, please.

660
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,960
Stage two separation.

661
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,800
All feeds going manual.

662
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,560
Going manual.

663
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,320
Deactivate probe heater one,
two and three.

664
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,440
Check.

665
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,800
Taking control.

666
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,400
This is handover to you.

667
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,040
- A.D.F. check.
- Over.

668
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,280
Pull thrusters back.
Fuel cells one, two, three.

669
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,480
100%.

670
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,320
Ex-mites.

671
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,880
It's hard leaving everything.

672
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,840
My kids. Your father.

673
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,520
We're gonna be spending
a lot of time together.

674
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,080
We should learn to talk.

675
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,680
And when not to.

676
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,120
Just being honest.

677
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,360
I don't think
you need to be that honest.

678
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,320
Hey, TARS,
what's your honesty parameter?

679
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,640
90%.

680
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,960
90%?

681
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,680
Absolute honesty isn't always
the most diplomatic

682
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,920
nor the safest form of communication
with emotional beings.

683
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,040
Okay.

684
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,000
90% it is, Dr. Brand.

685
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,680
We are coming up on the Endurance.
12 minutes out.

686
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,920
Okay. Taking control.

687
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,120
Approaching module port, 500m.

688
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
It's all you, Doyle.

689
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,200
Nice and easy, Doyle. Nice and easy.

690
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,080
I feel good.

691
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,480
Take us home.

692
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,760
- Lock.
- Target locked.

693
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,000
- Target locked.
- Well done.

694
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,120
Okay, helmets on.

695
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,200
Good job.

696
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,640
Door's not charging.

697
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,200
Never mind.

698
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,880
Cooper, you should have control.

699
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,680
Control here.

700
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,520
<i>Communication with
ring module active.</i>

701
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,240
Oh, wow.

702
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,120
That's initiate.

703
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,400
<i>Are we ready to spin?</i>

704
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,560
Just a sec.

705
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,720
Hello, CASE.

706
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,840
Hello, TARS.

707
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,320
All right, we're all set.

708
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,240
All right, let's do it.

709
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,880
30% of spin.

710
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,480
<i>One G.</i>

711
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,360
<i>How's gravity treating you
back there?</i>

712
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,720
Well.

713
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,600
Romilly? Hey, you okay?

714
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,760
- Yeah.
- You all right?

715
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,480
Yeah, I just need a minute.

716
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,520
Okay, I think we have
some Dramamine in the hab pod

717
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,600
I'm just gonna get that

718
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,256
or maybe in the cryo-beds.
I'll just be a sec.

719
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,880
- Hey, Brand?
- Yeah?

720
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,440
Bring a lot.

721
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,800
<i>Amelia, be safe.</i>

722
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,280
<i>Give my regards to Dr. Mann.</i>

723
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:14,800
I will, Dad.

724
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,800
<i>It looks good for your trajectory.
We've calculated two years to Saturn.</i>

725
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,880
That's a lot of Dramamine.

726
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,840
Look after my family,
will you, please, sir?

727
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:28,120
<i>We'll be waiting for you
when you get back.</i>

728
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:32,640
<i>A little older, a little wiser,
but happy to see you.</i>

729
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,000
<i>Do not go gentle into that good night</i>

730
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:42,800
<i>Old age should burn
and rave at close of day</i>

731
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:48,520
<i>Rage, rage against
the dying of the light</i>

732
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:53,320
<i>Though wise men at their end
know dark is right</i>

733
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,440
<i>Because their words had forked
no lightning they</i>

734
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,120
<i>Do not go gentle into that good night</i>

735
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,000
<i>Rage, rage against
the dying of the light</i>

736
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,400
- You good?
- Yeah.

737
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,880
Okay, thank you, sir.

738
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,360
Here. Pills.

739
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,320
So alone.

740
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,960
We have each other.
Dr. Mann had it worse.

741
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,320
No, I mean them.

742
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,880
It's a perfect planet, and we are not
gonna find another one like her.

743
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,120
No, it's not like
looking for a new condo.

744
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,520
The human race is going to be...

745
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,040
adrift...

746
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,680
desperate for a rock it can cling to
while it catches its breath.

747
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,520
We need to find that rock.

748
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,800
And our three prospects

749
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,680
are at the edge of
what might sustain human life.

750
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,520
Laura Miller's planet is first.

751
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,400
Laura started our biology program.

752
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,400
Wolf Edmunds is here.

753
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,640
Tell me about Edmunds.

754
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,040
Wolf's a particle physicist.

755
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,400
None of them had families, huh?

756
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,320
No. No attachments.
My father insisted.

757
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:29,040
They all knew the odds against ever
seeing another human being again.

758
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,136
I'm hoping we can surprise
at least three of them.

759
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,040
- How about Mann?
- Dr. Mann?

760
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,040
He's remarkable. He's the best of us.

761
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,320
He inspired 11 people to follow him

762
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,480
on the loneliest journey
in human history.

763
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,160
Scientists, explorers.

764
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,480
That's what I love.

765
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,320
You know, out there
we face great odds.

766
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,800
Death, but...

767
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,640
not evil.

768
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,920
What, you don't think
nature can be evil?

769
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,680
No. Formidable. Frightening. But...

770
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,800
no, not evil.

771
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,760
Is a lion evil
because it rips a gazelle to shreds?

772
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,880
Just what we take with us, then.

773
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:05,720
Yeah.

774
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,160
This crew represents
the best of humanity.

775
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,400
Even me, huh?

776
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,640
You know what? We agreed, 90%.

777
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:12,800
There you go.

778
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,000
- Don't stay up.
- I'll be there in a minute.

779
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:19,000
Just remember, Coop, you are
literally wasting your breath.

780
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,600
Hey, TARS? Let's go over
that trajectory one more time.

781
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,680
Eight months to Mars.

782
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:34,160
Counter-orbital slingshot around.
Fourteen months to Saturn.

783
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,400
Nothing's changed on that.

784
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:36,760
Just let me ask you something.

785
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:40,840
Dr. Brand and Edmunds...

786
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,720
Why are you whispering?
They can't hear you.

787
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,520
Dr. Brand and Edmunds. They close?

788
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:48,920
I wouldn't know.

789
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,800
Is that 90% "wouldn't know"
or 10% "wouldn't know"?

790
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,880
I also have
a discretion setting, Cooper.

791
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,120
But not a poker face, Slick.

792
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:11,400
Hey, guys.

793
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,760
Dad's about to go down
for the long nap.

794
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,720
So I wanted to give you an update.

795
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,760
<i>The Earth looks amazing from here.</i>

796
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,400
<i>You can't see any of the dust.</i>

797
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:30,120
<i>I really hope
you guys are doing great.</i>

798
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,056
<i>I know you're gonna get this message.</i>

799
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,880
<i>Professor Brand's assured me
that he's gonna get it to you, and...</i>

800
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,920
<i>know that I love you.</i>

801
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,920
- Is it him?
- I don't think so, Murph.

802
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,080
You must be Donald.

803
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,280
Hello, Murph.

804
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,880
Why are you in my dad's truck?

805
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,480
He wanted me
to bring it for your brother.

806
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,360
He sent you a message.

807
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,480
She's pretty upset
with him for leaving.

808
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:09,200
If you record any messages, I can
get them to transmit it to Cooper.

809
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,800
Murph is a bright spark.

810
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,520
Maybe I should fan the flame.

811
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,800
She's already making fools
of her teachers.

812
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,640
So maybe she should come
and make a fool out of you.

813
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,120
So where are they?

814
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,680
Heading for Mars.

815
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,320
The next time you hear from Cooper,
they'll be coming up on Saturn.

816
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,416
<i>As far as school goes,
the administration wants me</i>

817
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,000
<i>to repeat Plant Pathology.</i>

818
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:13,360
<i>Which sucks.</i>

819
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,120
<i>But they said I could start
Advanced Agriculture a year early.</i>

820
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,240
<i>All right, I got to go, Dad.
Hope you're safe up there.</i>

821
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,000
<i>Sorry, Coop.</i>

822
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:32,480
<i>I asked Murph to say hi,
but she's as stubborn as her old man.</i>

823
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,520
<i>I'll try again next time.</i>

824
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,480
You all right, Rom?

825
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,640
This gets to me, Cooper.

826
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,200
This...

827
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,680
Millimeters of aluminum,
that's it, and then nothing...

828
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:03,520
out there for millions of miles
won't kill us in seconds.

829
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,840
You know that some of the finest
solo yachtsmen in the world

830
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,000
don't know how to swim?

831
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,640
They don't know how. And
if they go overboard, they're done.

832
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,240
We're explorers, Rom.

833
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,240
This is our boat.

834
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:21,880
Here.

835
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:51,640
This is from the relay probe?
It was in orbit around the wormhole.

836
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,800
This is the wormhole,
and every time we'd come around

837
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:58,520
we would receive images from
the other side of the foreign galaxy.

838
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,600
Oh, yeah. Like swinging
a periscope around.

839
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,920
Exactly.

840
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,800
So we got a pretty good idea

841
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:05,800
what we're gonna find
on the other side, huh?

842
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,360
Navigationally.

843
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,200
<i>Guys? Looks like we'll be approaching
the wormhole in about three hours.</i>

844
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:20,720
Hey, Coop?

845
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,880
Can we stop the spinning?

846
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,360
Why?

847
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,640
Because we're close
enough to see it now?

848
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:29,760
All right.

849
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,000
Thanks.

850
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,520
There, that's it!
That's the wormhole!

851
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,200
Say it, don't spray it, Rom.

852
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:41,720
It's a sphere.

853
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,280
Of course it is. What, you...
You thought it would just be a hole?

854
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,120
No, it's just that all the
illustrations I've ever seen, they...

855
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,840
In the illustrations, they're trying
to show you how it works.

856
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:57,800
So they say you wanna go
from here to there.

857
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,360
But it's too far, right?

858
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:04,880
So a wormhole bends space like this,
so you can take a shortcut through

859
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:06,560
a higher dimension.

860
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,320
Okay, so

861
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,600
to show that, they've turned
three-dimensional space

862
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:12,680
into two dimensions

863
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:16,200
which turns a wormhole
into two dimensions, a circle.

864
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,680
What's a circle in three dimensions?

865
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,640
- A sphere.
- Exactly.

866
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,120
A spherical hole.

867
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,600
But who put it there?
Who do we have to thank?

868
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,000
I'm not thanking anybody until
we get out of here in one piece, Rom.

869
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,400
Any trick to this, Doyle?

870
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,200
No one knows.

871
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,000
The others made it, right?

872
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,520
At least some of them.

873
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:28,280
Everybody ready to say goodbye
to our solar system?

874
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:30,760
To our galaxy.

875
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,000
Here we go.

876
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,600
The controls won't work here.

877
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,320
We're passing through the bulk.

878
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,520
It's space beyond
our three dimensions.

879
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,920
All you can do is record and observe.

880
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:24,840
What is that?

881
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:28,520
I think it's them.

882
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,680
Distorting space-time.

883
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Don't...!

884
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:01,680
What was that?

885
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,000
The first handshake.

886
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:08,800
We're...

887
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,440
We're here.

888
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,360
So the lost communications
came through.

889
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:34,440
How?

890
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,360
The relay on this side cached them.

891
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:39,520
So years of basic data.
No real surprises.

892
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:43,720
Miller's site has kept pinging
thumbs up, as has Dr. Mann's.

893
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,120
Edmunds' went down three years ago.

894
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,040
Transmitter failure?

895
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:50,880
Maybe. He was sending the thumbs up
right until it went dark.

896
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,800
But Miller's still looks
good though, right?

897
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:54,720
Because she's coming up fast.

898
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,120
With one complication.

899
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:00,680
The planet is much closer
to Gargantua than we thought.

900
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:01,960
Gargantua?

901
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:03,560
It's what we're calling
the black hole.

902
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,680
Miller's and Dr. Mann's planets
both orbit it.

903
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,720
And Miller's is on the horizon?

904
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,200
As a basketball around a hoop.

905
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,200
Landing there takes us
dangerously close.

906
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:14,440
And a black hole that big
has a huge gravitational pull.

907
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:19,160
Look, I could swing
around that neutron star

908
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,680
- to decelerate.
- No, it's not that.

909
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,720
It's time. The gravity on that planet

910
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:26,160
will slow our clock
compared to Earth's drastically.

911
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:27,920
How bad?

912
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,320
Every hour we spend
on that planet will be...

913
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,480
seven years back on Earth.

914
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:36,400
Jesus.

915
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,280
Well, that's relativity, folks.

916
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:42,200
Well, we can't just drop
down there without...

917
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:44,080
Cooper, we have a mission.

918
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,360
Yeah, Doyle, we have a mission

919
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,640
and our mission Plan A is
to find a planet

920
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:50,136
that can habitate the people that
are living on the Earth right now.

921
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:51,336
You can't just think
about your family.

922
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:52,736
Now you have to think
bigger than that, all right?

923
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:55,800
I am thinking about my family
and millions of other families, okay?

924
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,440
Plan A does not work

925
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:00,080
if the people on Earth are dead
by the time we pull it off.

926
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,680
No. It doesn't.

927
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:04,800
That's why there's a Plan B.

928
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,400
Okay. Cooper's right.

929
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:09,856
We need to think about time
as a resource

930
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:10,920
just like oxygen and food.

931
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,280
Going down there's gonna cost us.

932
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,320
All right, look.

933
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,600
Doctor Mann's data
is promising, right?

934
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:20,480
But it's going to take us months
to get there.

935
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:22,200
And Edmunds', it's even further.

936
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:25,041
Now, Miller hasn't sent much, but
what she has said is very promising.

937
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:26,520
It's water, it's organics...

938
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:27,776
You don't find that every day.

939
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:30,200
No, you don't. And just think
about the resources

940
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:33,200
including time that would be spent
trying to get back here.

941
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,120
- Romilly.
- Yeah.

942
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,680
How far off from Miller's planet
do we have to be

943
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,200
to stay out of the time shift?

944
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,000
Just back from the cusp.

945
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:45,120
All right, which is here,
just outside of Miller's planet.

946
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,720
- Right.
- Okay.

947
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:50,520
Here's Gargantua.
Here's Miller's planet.

948
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,720
Instead of taking the Endurance
into orbit around Miller's planet

949
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:56,400
which would conserve fuel,
but we would lose a lot of time

950
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:59,760
what if we... we take
a wider orbit around Gargantua

951
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:03,120
parallel with Miller's planet
outside of this time shift, to here?

952
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,200
Then we take the Ranger down,
we get Miller, we get her samples.

953
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:08,800
We come back, we analyze, we debrief.
We're in, we're out.

954
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,360
We lose a little fuel,
but we save a whole lot of time.

955
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,040
- That'll work.
- That's good.

956
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:14,576
There's not gonna be time
for monkey business

957
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:15,640
or chit-chat down there.

958
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:18,320
So, TARS, you should
definitely stay here.

959
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,840
CASE, you're with me.
Anyone else can stay.

960
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:23,400
If we're talking about a couple years

961
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:25,080
I could use the time
to research gravity.

962
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:27,720
Observations from the wormhole,
that's gold to Professor Brand.

963
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,480
TARS, factor an orbit of Gargantua.

964
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:31,840
Conserve fuel, minimize thrusting

965
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,960
but make sure we stay
in range of Miller's planet.

966
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:36,200
- You got it?
- I wouldn't leave you behind

967
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:37,920
Dr. Brand.

968
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,560
- You ready, CASE?
- Yup.

969
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:45,920
You don't say much, do you?

970
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:47,880
TARS talks plenty for both of us.

971
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:50,160
Detach.

972
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,000
Romilly, are you reading
these forces?

973
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:00,120
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

974
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:04,880
A literal heart of darkness.

975
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:11,720
If we could just see
the collapsed star inside

976
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:14,560
the singularity,
yeah, we'd solve gravity.

977
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,560
And we can't get anything from it?

978
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,120
<i>Nothing escapes that horizon.</i>

979
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:19,320
Not even light.

980
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:22,000
<i>The answer's there,
just no way to see it.</i>

981
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:23,080
There's Miller's planet.

982
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:26,880
Goodbye, Ranger.

983
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:41,200
This is fast for atmospheric entry.

984
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,120
Should we use the thrusters to slow?

985
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:44,160
No.

986
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:47,280
I'm gonna use the Ranger's
aerodynamics to save some fuel.

987
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:48,560
Air brake?

988
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,160
We want to get down fast, don't we?

989
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,080
Actually, we want
to get there in one piece.

990
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:55,200
- Hang on.
- Brand, Doyle, get ready.

991
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,056
- We should ease!
- Hands where I can see them, CASE.

992
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:14,240
The only time I went down was

993
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,280
when a machine was easing
at the wrong time.

994
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,256
- A little caution would go...
- Can get you killed

995
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:19,360
just like reckless drivin'.

996
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,520
Cooper, it's too damn fast!

997
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:21,600
I got this.

998
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,560
Should I disable the feedback?

999
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,920
No. I need to feel the air.

1000
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,120
Here we go.

1001
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,040
It's just water!

1002
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:41,800
The stuff of life.

1003
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:43,520
1,200m.

1004
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,256
Do we have a fix on the beacon?

1005
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,720
Got it! Can you maneuver?

1006
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,200
I'll need to shave some speed.

1007
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:51,400
I'm gonna spiral down on top of it.
Everybody hang on!

1008
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:54,680
700.

1009
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:58,720
On my cue, CASE. On my cue.

1010
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,200
500m.

1011
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:13,440
Fire!

1012
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:27,600
Very graceful.

1013
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:28,680
No.

1014
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:32,200
But very efficient.

1015
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,720
What are you waiting for? Let's go!

1016
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,680
Go...!

1017
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,880
Seven years per hour here.
Let's make it count!

1018
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:07,320
This way.

1019
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,560
About 200m.

1020
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,520
The gravity's punishing.

1021
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:25,480
Been floating through space too long?

1022
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,680
130% Earth gravity.

1023
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,800
Come on...

1024
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:33,640
There's nothing here.

1025
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:35,000
Should be right here.

1026
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:39,720
If the signal's coming
from here, then...

1027
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:50,200
Her beacon.

1028
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,160
Wreckage.

1029
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:00,920
<i>Where's the rest?</i>

1030
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:02,600
Towards the mountains!

1031
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,040
Those aren't mountains.

1032
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,000
They're waves.

1033
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:18,920
Oh, shit...

1034
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,200
<i>All right, that one's
movin' away from us.</i>

1035
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:28,680
We need the recorder.

1036
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:40,960
Brand, Doyle, back to the Ranger now!

1037
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:44,360
We're not leaving without her data.

1038
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:45,680
Get back here now!

1039
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:47,320
We do not have time!

1040
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:48,960
The second wave is coming!

1041
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:50,360
We're in the middle of a swell.

1042
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,320
No, I got it.

1043
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,800
Get your ass back to the Ranger now!

1044
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:01,600
Brand, get back here now!

1045
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:05,600
No, Cooper, go... I can't make it.

1046
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:07,880
- Go!
- CASE, go get her.

1047
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,720
- Go!
- Get up. Get up, Brand!

1048
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:16,720
Go...!

1049
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:19,560
I'm not gonna make it!

1050
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,360
Yes, you are...!

1051
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:30,600
Come on, CASE has her...!
Get back here, Doyle!

1052
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:33,920
Come on!

1053
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:37,600
Get to the hatch!

1054
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:43,400
Go...!

1055
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:50,080
Shit.

1056
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:52,360
Manually overriding inside hatch!

1057
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:56,880
Cooper! Wait!

1058
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:00,440
Cooper!

1059
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,320
The engines are flooded!

1060
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,120
I'm gonna have to shut her down.

1061
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:40,600
Holy shit.

1062
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:46,080
Hang on!

1063
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:17,480
CASE, what's the problem?

1064
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:19,520
Too waterlogged. Let it drain.

1065
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,160
Goddamn it!

1066
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:24,520
- I told you to leave me!
- And I told you

1067
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,520
- Why didn't you?
- To get your ass back here!

1068
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:29,056
The difference is, one of us
was thinking about the mission

1069
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:30,136
- Brand!
- Cooper, you were thinking about

1070
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,200
getting home!

1071
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,120
I was trying to do the right thing!

1072
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,200
Can you tell that to Doyle?

1073
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:40,600
CASE, how much time?

1074
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:41,840
45 to an hour.

1075
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:44,680
The stuff of life, huh?

1076
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,960
What's this gonna cost us, Brand?

1077
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,840
A lot. Decades.

1078
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:58,040
What happened to Miller?

1079
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,800
Judging by the wreckage

1080
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,800
she was broken up
by a wave soon after impact.

1081
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:06,880
How's the wreckage stayed together
after all these years, huh?

1082
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:09,640
Because of the time slippage.

1083
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:14,880
On this planet's time,
she just landed hours ago.

1084
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:18,120
She probably just died minutes ago.

1085
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:22,320
The data Doyle received was just
the initial status echoing endlessly.

1086
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,680
Oh, we are not prepared for this.

1087
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:30,600
You eggheads have the survival skills
of a Boy Scout troop.

1088
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:33,920
Well, we got this far on our brains.
Farther than any human in history.

1089
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,320
Well, not far enough!

1090
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:37,360
And now we're stuck here

1091
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,360
till there won't be
anyone left on Earth to save.

1092
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:44,680
I'm counting every minute,
same as you, Cooper.

1093
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:52,360
Is there any possibility,
I don't know, some...

1094
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:54,920
some kind of a way we can
maybe all jump in... in a black hole?

1095
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,200
Gain back the years?

1096
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:58,600
Don't shake your head at me.

1097
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,720
Time is relative, okay?

1098
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:03,520
It can stretch
and it can squeeze, but

1099
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:06,400
it can't run backwards.
It just can't.

1100
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:09,680
No, the only thing that can
move across dimensions, like time

1101
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:10,760
is gravity.

1102
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:14,400
Okay.

1103
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:18,240
The beings that led us here

1104
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:21,400
they communicate
through gravity, right?

1105
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:22,520
Yes.

1106
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,320
Could they be talking to us
from the future?

1107
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,280
- Maybe.
- Okay. If they can...

1108
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:31,520
"They" are beings of five dimensions.

1109
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:35,200
All right? To them, time might be
another physical dimension.

1110
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:36,400
To them...

1111
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:41,000
the past might be a canyon that
they can climb into and the future

1112
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:44,240
a mountain they can climb up.
But to us, it's not, okay?

1113
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:46,680
Look, Cooper, I screwed up.

1114
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:48,120
I'm sorry.

1115
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,280
But you knew about relativity.

1116
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:55,480
Brand...

1117
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:01,680
My daughter was ten years old.

1118
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,120
I couldn't teach her
Einstein's theories before I left.

1119
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:08,320
Couldn't you have told her
you were going to save the world?

1120
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
No.

1121
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:15,200
When you become a parent,
one thing becomes really clear.

1122
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:19,720
And that is that you want
to make sure your children feel safe.

1123
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,920
And it rules out
telling a ten-year-old

1124
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,520
that the world is ending.

1125
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:27,880
Cooper?

1126
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:34,200
- How long for the engines, CASE?
- A minute or two.

1127
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:36,560
We don't have it. Helmets on!

1128
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,000
Brand, co-pilot, you're up.

1129
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,840
CASE, blow the cabin oxygen
through the main thrusters!

1130
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,360
- We're gonna spark it.
- Roger that.

1131
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:47,960
- Locked.
- Depressurizing.

1132
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:54,640
Engines up!

1133
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:23,480
Hello, Rom.

1134
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:25,760
I've waited years.

1135
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,560
How... How many years?

1136
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:31,600
By now it must be...

1137
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:33,360
It's 23 years

1138
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,120
four months, eight days.

1139
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:40,400
Doyle?

1140
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:49,400
I thought I was prepared.
I knew the theory.

1141
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,120
Reality's different.

1142
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,120
And Miller?

1143
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:57,080
There's nothing here for us.

1144
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:01,760
Why didn't you sleep?

1145
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,520
Oh, I had a couple of stretches.

1146
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:07,080
But I stopped believing
you were coming back.

1147
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:09,680
And something seemed wrong
about dreaming my life away.

1148
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:13,120
I learned what I could
from the black hole

1149
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:15,880
but I couldn't send anything
to your father.

1150
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:18,320
We've been receiving,
but nothing gets out.

1151
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:19,680
Is he alive?

1152
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:20,760
Oh, yeah.

1153
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,680
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1154
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:28,200
We've got years of messages stored.

1155
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:29,800
Cooper.

1156
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:32,760
<i>Messages span 23 years.</i>

1157
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:36,400
Play it from the beginning.

1158
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:40,480
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>

1159
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:44,000
<i>Checking in. Saying hi.</i>

1160
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,320
<i>Finished second in school.</i>

1161
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:52,160
<i>Miss Kurling's still
giving me C's though.</i>

1162
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:55,040
<i>Pulled me down,
but, you know, second's not bad.</i>

1163
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:58,320
<i>Grandpa attended the ceremony.</i>

1164
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:02,280
<i>Oh.</i>

1165
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:04,560
<i>I met another girl, Dad.</i>

1166
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,120
<i>I...</i>

1167
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,040
<i>I really think this is the one.</i>

1168
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:11,440
<i>Name's Lois.</i>

1169
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:12,800
<i>That's her right there.</i>

1170
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,400
<i>Murphy stole Grandpa's car.</i>

1171
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,760
<i>She crashed it. She's okay, though.</i>

1172
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:22,600
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>

1173
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:24,800
<i>Look at this.</i>

1174
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:26,800
<i>You're a grandpa.</i>

1175
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:29,760
<i>His name's Jesse.</i>

1176
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:35,360
<i>I kind of wanted to call him Coop,
but Lois says maybe next time.</i>

1177
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,720
<i>Donald says he's already earned
the "great" part</i>

1178
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:39,680
<i>so we just leave it at that.</i>

1179
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:45,080
<i>Oh, dear...</i>

1180
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:47,080
<i>Say "Bye-bye, Grandpa."</i>

1181
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,560
<i>Bye-bye, Grandpa. Okay.</i>

1182
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:51,000
<i>Sorry it's been a while.</i>

1183
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:54,360
<i>Just...</i>

1184
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:58,000
<i>what with Jesse and all.</i>

1185
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,400
<i>Grandpa died last week.</i>

1186
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:10,000
<i>We buried him out in the back forty
next to Mom and...</i>

1187
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
<i>Jesse.</i>

1188
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:15,720
<i>Which is where we would
have buried you if you'd ever...</i>

1189
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:17,800
<i>come back.</i>

1190
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:21,240
<i>Murph was there at the funeral.</i>

1191
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:24,760
<i>We don't see her that much,
but she came for that.</i>

1192
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:30,040
<i>You aren't listening to this,
I know that.</i>

1193
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:35,640
<i>All these messages are just, like...</i>

1194
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:40,640
<i>drifting out there in the darkness.</i>

1195
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:43,520
<i>Lois says that...</i>

1196
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:46,880
<i>I have to let you go.</i>

1197
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:49,000
<i>And...</i>

1198
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:50,640
<i>so...</i>

1199
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:57,000
<i>I guess I'm letting you go.</i>

1200
01:17:57,880 --> 01:17:59,720
<i>I don't know where you are, Dad...</i>

1201
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,200
<i>but I hope that
you're at peace and...</i>

1202
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,280
<i>Goodbye.</i>

1203
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:20,400
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>

1204
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:24,320
Hey, Murph.

1205
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:26,000
<i>You son of a bitch.</i>

1206
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:32,520
<i>I never made one of these
when you were still responding</i>

1207
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:34,400
<i>'cause I was so mad
at you for leaving.</i>

1208
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:39,480
<i>And then when you went quiet, it...</i>

1209
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:44,600
<i>seemed like I should live
with that decision. And I have.</i>

1210
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:51,200
<i>But today's my birthday.</i>

1211
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,680
<i>And it's a special one,
because you told me...</i>

1212
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:05,760
<i>You once told me that when you
came back, we might be the same age.</i>

1213
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:10,400
<i>And today I'm the age
you were when you left.</i>

1214
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:16,080
<i>So it would be a real good time
for you to come back.</i>

1215
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,320
I didn't mean to intrude.

1216
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:34,240
It's just that
I've never seen you in here before.

1217
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,000
I've never been in here before.

1218
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:40,880
I talk to Amelia all the time.

1219
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:42,520
It helps.

1220
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:44,720
I'm glad you've started.

1221
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,160
- I...
- I haven't. I...

1222
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:48,040
just had something
I needed to get out.

1223
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:50,280
I know they're still out there.

1224
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:51,360
I know.

1225
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:52,480
There are so many reasons

1226
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:55,480
their communications
might not be getting through.

1227
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:56,920
I know, Professor.

1228
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:00,920
I'm not sure what I'm more afraid of.

1229
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,520
Them never coming back or...

1230
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:08,000
coming back to find we've failed.

1231
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:09,400
Then let's succeed.

1232
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:11,400
So...

1233
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:16,160
back to the fourth iteration.
Let's run it through some new fields.

1234
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:19,480
With respect, Professor,
we've tried that hundreds of times.

1235
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:23,200
It only has to work once, Murph.

1236
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:29,600
Every rivet that they strike
could have been a bullet.

1237
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
We've done well for the world here

1238
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:36,520
whether or not we crack the equation
before I kick the bucket.

1239
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,560
Don't be morbid, Professor.

1240
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:40,080
I'm not afraid of death.

1241
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:41,920
I'm an old physicist.

1242
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:45,000
I'm afraid of time.

1243
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:53,040
Time.

1244
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:56,600
You're afraid of time.

1245
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:00,976
For years we've been trying
to solve the equation

1246
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,600
without changing
the underlying assumption about time.

1247
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:05,320
- And?
- And that means

1248
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:09,120
each iteration is an attempt
to prove its own proof. It's...

1249
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,120
recursive. It's nonsensical.

1250
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:16,000
Are you calling my life's work
nonsense, Murph?

1251
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,720
No, I'm saying that
you've been trying to

1252
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:21,320
finish it with one arm, no,
with both arms tied behind your back.

1253
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,400
And I don't understand why.

1254
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:28,040
I'm an old man, Murph.

1255
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:31,560
Can we take this point up
at another time?

1256
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:33,680
I want to talk to my daughter.

1257
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:38,240
<i>Stepping out into the universe</i>

1258
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:42,800
<i>we must confront the reality
of interstellar travel.</i>

1259
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:47,600
<i>We must reach
far beyond our own lifespans.</i>

1260
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:52,640
<i>We must think not as individuals
but as a species.</i>

1261
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:58,360
<i>Do not go gentle into that good night</i>

1262
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:02,400
TARS kept the Endurance
right where we needed her.

1263
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:05,280
But the trip took years longer
than we anticipated.

1264
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:08,560
We no longer have the fuel
to visit both prospects, so...

1265
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,360
we have to choose.

1266
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:12,760
But how?

1267
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,160
They're both promising.

1268
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:21,400
Edmunds' data is better, but Dr. Mann
is the one still transmitting, so...

1269
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:24,000
We've no reason to suspect
Edmunds's data would have soured.

1270
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:27,600
His world has key elements
to sustain human life.

1271
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,080
As does Dr. Mann's.

1272
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:30,520
Cooper, this is my field.

1273
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:32,960
And...

1274
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,736
I really believe
Edmunds' is the better prospect.

1275
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:36,760
Why?

1276
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:38,760
Gargantua, that's why.

1277
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:43,680
Look at Miller's planet.
Hydrocarbons, organics, yes

1278
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,440
but no life. Sterile.

1279
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:48,720
We'll find the same thing on Mann's.

1280
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:50,200
Because of the black hole?

1281
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:53,400
Murphy's Law.
Whatever can happen will happen.

1282
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,120
Accident is the first building block
of evolution.

1283
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:59,000
But when you're orbiting a black hole
not enough can happen.

1284
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:01,560
It sucks in asteroids and comets

1285
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:03,520
other events
which would otherwise reach you.

1286
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:04,920
We need to go further afield.

1287
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,880
You once said that Dr. Mann...

1288
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:10,880
was the best of us.

1289
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:14,200
He's remarkable.
We're only here because of him.

1290
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:16,280
And yet here he is.

1291
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:17,680
He's on the ground

1292
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:20,600
and he's sending
a very unambiguous message

1293
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:22,880
telling us to come to his planet.

1294
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:27,840
Granted, but Edmunds' data
is more promising.

1295
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:29,240
We should vote.

1296
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:31,880
Well, if we're going to vote,
there's something you should know.

1297
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:33,520
Brand?

1298
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,200
He has a right to know.

1299
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,400
That has nothing to do with it.

1300
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:38,680
What does?

1301
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:40,480
She's in love with Wolf Edmunds.

1302
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:41,720
Is that true?

1303
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:43,080
Yes.

1304
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:48,400
And that makes me
want to follow my heart.

1305
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:55,440
But maybe we've spent too long trying
to figure all this out with theory.

1306
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:57,080
You're a scientist, Brand.

1307
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:58,360
So listen to me...

1308
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:03,640
when I say that love isn't
something we invented. It's...

1309
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,760
observable, powerful.

1310
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:10,600
It has to mean something.

1311
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:12,240
Love has meaning, yes.

1312
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:15,040
Social utility,
social bonding, child rearing...

1313
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:18,640
We love people who have died.
Where's the social utility in that?

1314
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:20,520
None.

1315
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:26,280
Maybe it means something more,
something we can't yet understand.

1316
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:29,480
Maybe it's some evidence, some...

1317
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:34,720
artifact of a higher dimension
that we can't consciously perceive.

1318
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:39,720
I'm drawn across the universe
to someone I haven't seen in a decade

1319
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:42,200
who I know is probably dead.

1320
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:46,120
Love is the one thing
we're capable of perceiving

1321
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:48,560
that transcends dimensions
of time and space.

1322
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:54,520
Maybe we should trust that,
even if we can't understand it yet.

1323
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:00,920
All right, Cooper.

1324
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:04,200
Yes...

1325
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:08,520
the tiniest possibility
of seeing Wolf again excites me.

1326
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:10,800
That doesn't mean I'm wrong.

1327
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:13,400
Honestly, Amelia...

1328
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:16,640
it might.

1329
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:25,560
TARS, chart a course for Dr. Mann's.

1330
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:43,480
We'll lose about a third again.

1331
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:44,760
But next year...

1332
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:49,800
next year I'm gonna work
Nelson's farm and we'll make it up.

1333
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:52,040
What happened to Nelson?

1334
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:00,336
Murph, have you eaten enough?
Would you like some more soufflé?

1335
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:03,200
Oh, no. I'm full, thanks.
It was delicious.

1336
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:06,000
Coop, finish your fritter, please.

1337
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:10,080
Will you spend the night?

1338
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:12,040
Your room is exactly as you left it.

1339
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:13,480
- It's ready.
- I need to get back.

1340
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:15,456
My sewing machine is in there,
but there's plenty...

1341
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:17,000
I need to...

1342
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:21,360
Too many memories.

1343
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:23,800
We might have something for that.

1344
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:25,360
Hey, Coop.

1345
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:33,400
The dust.

1346
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:37,840
Lois, I have a friend who...

1347
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:40,040
could look at his lungs.

1348
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Amelia, I'm sorry.

1349
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:00,320
You were just being objective.

1350
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:03,520
Unless you're punishing me
for screwing up on Miller's planet.

1351
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:06,000
No, this wasn't a personal decision.

1352
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:10,240
If you're wrong, you will have
a very personal decision to make.

1353
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:13,800
Your fuel calculations
are based on a return journey.

1354
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:15,880
Strike out on Mann's planet

1355
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:17,800
and we'll have to decide
whether to return home

1356
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,120
or push on to Edmunds' with Plan B.

1357
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:24,080
Starting a colony could save us
from extinction.

1358
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:27,280
You might have to decide
between seeing your children again

1359
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:29,200
and the future of the human race.

1360
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:31,920
I trust you'll be as objective then.

1361
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:40,720
He's been asking for you
since he came to.

1362
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:42,320
We were trying to reach you.

1363
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:49,440
Murph.

1364
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:51,320
I'm here, Professor.

1365
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,200
I let you all down.

1366
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:57,640
No, you got us so far. Real close.

1367
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,200
I'll finish what you started.

1368
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:03,480
Good, good Murph.

1369
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:08,000
You had faith...

1370
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:10,360
all those...

1371
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:12,920
all those years.

1372
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:15,760
I...

1373
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:18,480
I asked you to have faith.

1374
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:22,520
I wanted you to believe...

1375
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:25,880
that your father...

1376
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,440
would come back.

1377
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:32,600
I do, Professor.

1378
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,120
Forgive me, Murph.

1379
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:37,520
There's nothing to forgive.

1380
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:43,240
I... I lied, Murph.

1381
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:47,280
I lied to you.

1382
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:56,800
There was no need for him to...

1383
01:28:57,960 --> 01:28:59,320
to come back.

1384
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:05,520
There is no way to help us.

1385
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:07,600
But Plan A...

1386
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:11,400
All this. All these people.

1387
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:13,880
And the equation.

1388
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:19,320
Did my father know?

1389
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:24,520
Did he leave me?

1390
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:29,680
<i>Do...</i>

1391
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,000
<i>not...</i>

1392
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:34,040
<i>go...</i>

1393
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:36,880
<i>gentle...</i>

1394
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:39,880
No.

1395
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:42,400
No!

1396
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:45,000
You can't leave.

1397
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:46,760
You... No.

1398
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:51,000
Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you
that your father died today.

1399
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:52,400
He had no pain.

1400
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,120
He was at peace.

1401
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,680
I'm very sorry for your loss.

1402
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:10,640
Brand, did you know?

1403
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:14,320
<i>He told you, right?</i>

1404
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:18,640
<i>You knew.</i>

1405
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:22,000
This was all a sham.

1406
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:28,000
<i>You left us here.</i>

1407
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:31,400
<i>To suffocate.</i>

1408
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:34,920
<i>To starve.</i>

1409
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:02,440
Frozen cloud.

1410
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:22,040
It's okay.

1411
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:23,760
It's okay.

1412
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:31,680
It's okay.

1413
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:33,080
Yeah.

1414
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:38,520
Pray you never learn...

1415
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:42,920
just how good it can be
to see another face.

1416
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:55,760
I hadn't a lot of hope to begin with,
but after so long, I had none.

1417
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:00,000
My supplies were
completely exhausted.

1418
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:05,600
The last time I went to sleep,
I didn't even set a waking date.

1419
01:34:09,680 --> 01:34:12,000
You have literally raised me
from the dead.

1420
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:14,160
Lazarus.

1421
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:17,200
What about the others?

1422
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:19,200
I'm afraid you're it, sir.

1423
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:22,120
So far, surely.

1424
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,880
No, our present situation is that

1425
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:27,680
there's very little chance
of rescuing any others.

1426
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:32,280
Dr. Mann.

1427
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:33,720
Dr. Mann?

1428
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:35,680
Tell us about your world.

1429
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:40,680
Our world, we hope.

1430
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:46,680
Our world is cold

1431
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:48,160
stark...

1432
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,640
but undeniably beautiful.

1433
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:56,680
The days are 67 hours long, cold.

1434
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:02,360
The nights are

1435
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:04,600
67 far colder hours.

1436
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:14,600
The gravity is a very, very pleasant
80% of the Earth's.

1437
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:17,880
Now, up here where I landed,
the water is alkali

1438
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:19,680
and the air has too much ammonia

1439
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:21,136
to breathe for
more than just a few minutes

1440
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:23,280
but down at the surface

1441
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:26,000
and there is a surface

1442
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:27,480
the chlorine dissipates.

1443
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:31,520
The ammonia gives way to crystalline
hydrocarbons and breathable air.

1444
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:33,200
To organics.

1445
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:35,800
Possibly even to life.

1446
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:38,400
We might be sharing this world.

1447
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:40,960
These readings are from the surface?

1448
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Over the years,
I've dropped various probes.

1449
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:45,880
How far have you explored?

1450
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:47,960
I've mounted
several major expeditions.

1451
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:49,560
But with oxygen in limited supply

1452
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:51,520
KIPP there really did
most of the legwork.

1453
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:53,480
What went wrong with him, sir?

1454
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:54,720
Degeneration.

1455
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:58,000
He misidentified the first organics
we found as ammonia crystals.

1456
01:35:58,440 --> 01:36:02,280
We struggled on for a time, but
ultimately I decommissioned him and

1457
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:04,600
used his power source
to keep the mission going.

1458
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,120
I thought I was alone
before I shut him down.

1459
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:09,200
Would you like me to look at him?

1460
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:12,080
No... He needs a human touch.

1461
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:16,320
Dr. Brand, CASE is relaying a message
for you from the comm station.

1462
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:18,880
Okay. Be right there. Excuse me.

1463
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:33,400
<i>Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you
that your father died today.</i>

1464
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:34,920
<i>He had no pain.</i>

1465
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:39,400
<i>He was at peace.</i>

1466
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:43,200
<i>I'm sorry for your loss.</i>

1467
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:47,000
Is that Murph?

1468
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:49,800
She's... She's grown.

1469
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:51,120
<i>Brand, did you know?</i>

1470
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:53,920
<i>He told you, right?</i>

1471
01:36:57,120 --> 01:36:58,200
<i>You knew.</i>

1472
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:01,400
<i>This was all a sham.</i>

1473
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:03,760
<i>You left us here.</i>

1474
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,200
<i>To suffocate.</i>

1475
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:10,680
<i>To starve.</i>

1476
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:15,680
<i>Did my father know too?</i>

1477
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:19,080
<i>Dad?</i>

1478
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:22,600
<i>I just want to know...</i>

1479
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:26,120
<i>if you left me here to die.</i>

1480
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:30,240
<i>I just have to know.</i>

1481
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:37,160
Cooper, my...

1482
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:40,360
My father dedicated

1483
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:42,760
his whole life to Plan A.

1484
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:45,760
I have no idea
what she's talking about.

1485
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:48,400
I do.

1486
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:56,120
What, he never even hoped
to get the people off the Earth?

1487
01:37:57,160 --> 01:37:58,200
No.

1488
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:05,600
But he's been trying to solve
the gravity equation for 40 years.

1489
01:38:06,440 --> 01:38:09,680
Amelia, your father solved
his equation before I even left.

1490
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:11,960
Then why wouldn't he use it?

1491
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:15,400
The equation couldn't reconcile
relativity with quantum mechanics.

1492
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:17,680
- You need more.
- More? More what?

1493
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:21,040
More data. You need
to see into a black hole.

1494
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:23,360
The laws of nature prohibit
a naked singularity.

1495
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:24,680
Romilly, is that true?

1496
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:29,600
If a black hole is an oyster, then
the singularity's the pearl inside.

1497
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:32,280
The gravity's so strong,
it's always hidden in darkness

1498
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:33,680
behind the horizon.

1499
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:37,120
That's why we call it a black hole.

1500
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:38,480
Okay, but...

1501
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:41,320
if we see beyond the horizon...

1502
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:42,680
We can't, Coop.

1503
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:45,000
There are some things
that aren't meant to be known.

1504
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:47,160
Your father had to find another way

1505
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:49,440
to save the human race
from extinction.

1506
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:51,000
Plan B. A colony.

1507
01:38:51,080 --> 01:38:52,400
Why not tell people?

1508
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:56,176
- Why keep building those stations?
- Because he knew

1509
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:58,640
how hard it would be
to get people to work together

1510
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:00,800
to save the species
instead of themselves.

1511
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:02,680
Or their children.

1512
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:03,960
Bullshit.

1513
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:06,880
You never woulda come here unless you
believed you were gonna save them.

1514
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:09,400
Evolution has yet to transcend
that simple barrier.

1515
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:11,960
We can care deeply, selflessly

1516
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:13,280
about those we know

1517
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:15,920
but that empathy rarely extends
beyond our line of sight.

1518
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:17,400
But the lie.

1519
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:23,000
That monstrous lie?

1520
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:25,320
Unforgivable.

1521
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:26,880
And he knew that.

1522
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:30,240
He was prepared
to destroy his own humanity

1523
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:33,320
in order to save the species.
He made an incredible sacrifice.

1524
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:34,400
No.

1525
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:38,000
An incredible sacrifice is being made

1526
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:40,520
by the people on Earth
who are gonna die!

1527
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:43,000
Because in his fucking arrogance

1528
01:39:43,480 --> 01:39:45,200
he declared their case hopeless.

1529
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:47,320
I'm sorry, Cooper

1530
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:49,480
their case is hopeless.

1531
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:51,720
No...

1532
01:39:52,160 --> 01:39:53,480
We are the future.

1533
01:39:57,120 --> 01:39:58,680
Cooper, what can I do?

1534
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:03,400
Let me go home.

1535
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:06,240
You're absolutely positive?

1536
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:09,240
His solution was correct.
He'd had it for years.

1537
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:11,000
It's worthless?

1538
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:12,400
It's half the answer.

1539
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:16,400
Okay, how do you find the other half?

1540
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:18,400
Out there? A black hole.

1541
01:40:18,640 --> 01:40:20,360
But stuck down here on Earth?

1542
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:21,440
Yeah?

1543
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:23,920
I'm not sure you can.

1544
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:28,560
God, they just pack up and leave.

1545
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:31,680
What are they hoping to find?

1546
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:33,600
Survival.

1547
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:41,800
Damn it.

1548
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:46,680
Murph, don't...

1549
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:48,720
Don't people have a right to know?

1550
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:52,880
No, panic won't help. We just have to
keep working, same as ever.

1551
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:54,240
Yeah, but

1552
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:55,976
isn't that exactly
what Professor Brand was

1553
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,656
- manipulating us to do?
- Brand gave up on us.

1554
01:40:57,680 --> 01:40:59,200
I'm still trying to solve this.

1555
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:01,160
So...

1556
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:04,000
do you have an idea?

1557
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:05,920
A feeling.

1558
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:10,880
I told you about my ghost.

1559
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:15,120
My dad thought I called it a ghost

1560
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:16,800
because I was scared of it.

1561
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:22,240
But I was never scared of it.

1562
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:26,240
I called it a ghost
because it felt...

1563
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,360
felt like a person.

1564
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:34,920
It was trying to tell me something.

1565
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:40,200
If there's an answer here on Earth,
it's back there

1566
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:42,200
somehow, in that room.

1567
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:44,320
So I have to find it.

1568
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:49,520
We're running out of time.

1569
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:53,520
<i>What about
auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?</i>

1570
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:55,896
No, they can stay, CASE. I'll be
sleeping most of the way anyway.

1571
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:57,200
- Hey, Coop.
- Yeah?

1572
01:41:57,560 --> 01:41:59,520
I have a suggestion
for your return journey.

1573
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:00,600
Yeah, what's that?

1574
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:02,280
Have one last crack
at the black hole.

1575
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:05,280
I'm going home, Rom.

1576
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:08,520
Yeah, I know. This isn't
going to cost you any time.

1577
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:11,480
There's a chance
for the people on Earth.

1578
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,040
- Talk to me.
- Gargantua's

1579
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:14,800
an older spinning black hole.

1580
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:16,280
It's what we call a...

1581
01:42:16,360 --> 01:42:18,800
- a gentle singularity.
- Gentle?

1582
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,080
They're hardly gentle.

1583
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:22,200
But the tidal gravity
is so quick that

1584
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:25,680
something crossing the horizon fast
might survive.

1585
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:26,760
A probe, say.

1586
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:28,080
What happens after it crosses?

1587
01:42:28,160 --> 01:42:31,320
After the horizon is
a complete mystery.

1588
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:34,400
So, what's to say
there isn't some way that the probe

1589
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:37,040
can glimpse the singularity
and relay the quantum data?

1590
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:40,600
If he's equipped to transmit
every form of energy that can pulse.

1591
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:43,800
Just when did this probe
become a "he," Professor?

1592
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:45,600
TARS is the obvious candidate.

1593
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:48,280
I've already told him
what to look for.

1594
01:42:48,360 --> 01:42:51,000
I'd need the old optical transmitter
off KIPP, Cooper.

1595
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:52,400
You'd do this for us?

1596
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:53,640
Before you get all teary

1597
01:42:53,720 --> 01:42:56,400
try to remember that as a robot
I have to do anything you say.

1598
01:42:57,360 --> 01:42:58,600
Your cue light's broken.

1599
01:42:58,760 --> 01:42:59,880
I'm not joking.

1600
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:06,040
I'm gonna need TARS to remove
and adapt some components from KIPP.

1601
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:08,440
Well, I don't want to disturb
his archival functions.

1602
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:09,760
I'll supervise.

1603
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:11,400
All right.

1604
01:43:11,480 --> 01:43:13,640
Dr. Mann, we need
to find three secure sites.

1605
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:16,280
One for Brand's lab, two for habitat.

1606
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:18,536
Once those modules have landed,
you don't want to move them.

1607
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:21,120
I can take you to the probe sites,
but I don't think these...

1608
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:23,720
these conditions are gonna hold.
I think we should wait.

1609
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:26,680
CASE is headed back down with
the rest of the distillery equipment.

1610
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:29,320
I'd really like to secure
those sites by nightfall.

1611
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:34,600
Well, these squalls
do usually blow over.

1612
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:36,480
- Okay, then.
- But you're gonna need

1613
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:38,080
- a long-range transmitter.
- Got it.

1614
01:43:38,280 --> 01:43:39,400
- Are you charged?
- Yeah.

1615
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:41,280
Follow me.

1616
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:44,120
TARS, 72 hours, yeah?

1617
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:45,480
Roger that, Cooper.

1618
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:54,120
Brand told me why you feel
you have to go back.

1619
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:58,440
But I'd be remiss
if I didn't at least mention that

1620
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:02,880
a mission such as ours could
certainly use an extra engineer.

1621
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:06,800
You better slow down, turbo.

1622
01:44:07,320 --> 01:44:09,400
Safety first, CASE, remember.

1623
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:10,920
<i>Safety first, Cooper.</i>

1624
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:15,200
I have to tell you, Dr. Mann,
I'm honored to be a part of this.

1625
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:17,360
But once we set up base camp

1626
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:20,200
and secure those modules,
my work's done here.

1627
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:22,120
I'm going home.

1628
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:31,280
You have attachments.

1629
01:44:31,720 --> 01:44:32,880
But even without a family

1630
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:38,080
I can promise you that that yearning
to be with other people is powerful.

1631
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:41,680
That emotion is at the foundation

1632
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:45,320
of what makes us human.
It's not to be taken lightly.

1633
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:54,480
How long have you had that cough?

1634
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:55,560
A while.

1635
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:07,240
Mom lets me play in here.

1636
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:10,200
I don't touch your stuff.

1637
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:41,520
Just take this gently.

1638
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,176
You know why we couldn't just
send machines on these missions

1639
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:50,200
don't you, Cooper?

1640
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:52,520
A machine doesn't improvise well

1641
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:54,720
because you can't
program a fear of death.

1642
01:45:55,960 --> 01:45:59,560
Our survival instinct is our single
greatest source of inspiration.

1643
01:46:00,040 --> 01:46:01,360
Take you, for example.

1644
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:03,360
A father...

1645
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:07,080
with a survival instinct
that extends to your kids.

1646
01:46:08,040 --> 01:46:09,680
What does research tell us

1647
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:12,240
is the last thing
you're gonna see before you die?

1648
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:15,280
Your children.

1649
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,040
Their faces.

1650
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:19,320
At the moment of death,
your mind's gonna push

1651
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:20,880
a little bit harder to survive.

1652
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:22,840
For them.

1653
01:46:23,640 --> 01:46:24,720
Deep breath.

1654
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:30,520
Hey. I bet you're Coop. Why don't you
have a seat here for me?

1655
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:32,880
It's bad. They cannot stay here.

1656
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:35,000
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1657
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:44,480
TARS, what's taking so long?

1658
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:47,080
Professor, I am having trouble
completing the boot up.

1659
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:48,720
I don't understand.

1660
01:46:55,560 --> 01:46:56,640
It's funny.

1661
01:46:58,840 --> 01:47:00,160
When I left Earth...

1662
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:03,040
I thought I was prepared to die.

1663
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:06,360
The truth is...

1664
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:11,360
I never really considered
the possibility

1665
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:13,120
that my planet wasn't the one.

1666
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,080
Nothing worked out the way
it was supposed to.

1667
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:19,400
Let's go.

1668
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:30,240
All right, hey, buddy, why don't you
give me a big deep breath?

1669
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:36,120
What is this?

1670
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:37,480
What are you doing?

1671
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:40,320
I'm sorry! I can't let you
leave with that ship.

1672
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:42,760
We're gonna need it
to complete the mission

1673
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:46,280
once the others realize
what this place isn't.

1674
01:47:46,600 --> 01:47:49,320
We cannot survive here. I'm sorry!

1675
01:47:49,680 --> 01:47:50,720
I'm sorry!

1676
01:47:55,240 --> 01:47:56,320
No!

1677
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:01,320
They can't stay here anymore.

1678
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:03,000
You have to leave right now.

1679
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:05,136
Okay, let me... let me make
something abundantly clear.

1680
01:48:05,160 --> 01:48:06,280
You have a responsibility...

1681
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:07,720
Oh! Jesus!

1682
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:09,400
Coop, get her stuff.
She's going home.

1683
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:12,120
Dad didn't raise you
to be this dumb, Tom!

1684
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:13,680
Dad didn't raise me, Grandpa did.

1685
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:15,880
And he's buried out back
with Mom and Jesse.

1686
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:18,880
You faked all the data?

1687
01:48:20,840 --> 01:48:21,840
Yeah.

1688
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:27,120
There's no surface?

1689
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:28,400
No.

1690
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:31,440
I tried to do my duty, Cooper

1691
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:34,680
but I knew
the day that I arrived here

1692
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:36,520
that this place had nothing.

1693
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:40,520
And I resisted
the temptation for years

1694
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:43,480
but I... I knew that

1695
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:48,320
if I just pressed that button, then
somebody would come and save me.

1696
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:51,080
You fucking coward.

1697
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:53,080
Yes.

1698
01:48:57,880 --> 01:48:58,880
Yes.

1699
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:01,800
Yes.

1700
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:04,000
Yes.

1701
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:17,560
Listen, if you're not gonna go,
let your family go.

1702
01:49:17,640 --> 01:49:19,400
Just, like, save your family.

1703
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,280
And we go live underground with you?

1704
01:49:22,360 --> 01:49:24,120
Pray that Daddy comes to save us?

1705
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:26,880
Dad's not coming back.
He never was coming back.

1706
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:28,160
It's up to me.

1707
01:49:28,240 --> 01:49:29,600
You're gonna save everybody?

1708
01:49:29,880 --> 01:49:30,960
Because Dad couldn't do it.

1709
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,720
Dad didn't even try!

1710
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,600
Dad just abandoned us!

1711
01:49:35,560 --> 01:49:37,240
He left us here to die.

1712
01:49:38,240 --> 01:49:39,600
Nobody's going with you.

1713
01:49:43,320 --> 01:49:45,520
You gonna wait
for your next kid to die?

1714
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:49,720
Get out.

1715
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:52,160
And don't come back.

1716
01:49:56,720 --> 01:49:58,160
You can keep my stuff.

1717
01:50:08,920 --> 01:50:09,920
Stop it!

1718
01:50:13,080 --> 01:50:14,520
No. No!

1719
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:18,400
Dr. Mann, there's a 50-50 chance
you're gonna kill yourself!

1720
01:50:19,480 --> 01:50:21,320
Those are the best odds
I've had in years.

1721
01:50:40,760 --> 01:50:42,400
Don't judge me, Cooper.

1722
01:50:43,320 --> 01:50:45,200
You were never tested like I was.

1723
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:47,480
Few men have been.

1724
01:50:55,680 --> 01:50:56,840
You tried your best, Murph.

1725
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:07,200
You're feeling it, aren't you?

1726
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:10,120
The survival instinct.

1727
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:12,520
That's what drove me.

1728
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:15,320
It's what drives all of us.
And it's what's gonna save us.

1729
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:19,520
Because I want to save all of us.
For you, Cooper.

1730
01:51:24,680 --> 01:51:28,200
I'm sorry, I can't... I can't watch
you go through this. I'm sorry.

1731
01:51:28,280 --> 01:51:30,800
I thought I could, but I can't.

1732
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,120
I'm here. I'm here for you.

1733
01:51:34,200 --> 01:51:36,000
Just listen to my voice, Cooper.

1734
01:51:37,080 --> 01:51:38,120
I'm right here.

1735
01:51:40,040 --> 01:51:41,160
You're not alone.

1736
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:52,320
Do you see your children?

1737
01:51:55,360 --> 01:51:56,440
It's okay.

1738
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:58,800
They're right there with you.

1739
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:05,480
Did Professor Brand tell you
that poem before you left?

1740
01:52:06,240 --> 01:52:07,400
Do you remember?

1741
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:12,720
<i>Do not go gentle into that good night</i>

1742
01:52:14,160 --> 01:52:18,520
<i>Old age should burn and rave
at close of day</i>

1743
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:23,080
<i>Rage, rage against
the dying of the light</i>

1744
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:47,640
Brand! Help!

1745
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:49,520
- <i>Help...!</i>
- Cooper?

1746
01:52:56,120 --> 01:52:57,120
CASE!

1747
01:52:57,760 --> 01:52:58,800
No air.

1748
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:00,680
Ammonia.

1749
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:04,320
Cooper. Cooper, we're coming! CASE!

1750
01:53:04,600 --> 01:53:06,360
- I have a fix.
- Go...!

1751
01:53:06,440 --> 01:53:08,000
And away!

1752
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:21,920
Cooper, we're coming.
Hang in there. Don't talk.

1753
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,280
Try to breathe as little as possible.
We're almost there.

1754
01:53:27,640 --> 01:53:29,280
There's a security lockout, sir.

1755
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:32,520
It requires a person
to access function.

1756
01:53:37,720 --> 01:53:38,720
It's all yours, sir.

1757
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:48,000
<i>Try not to breathe.</i>

1758
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:50,440
<i>We're coming...</i>

1759
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:52,520
<i>We're coming right now.
CASE, come on! Come on!</i>

1760
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:54,296
<i>We got to go faster, CASE!
We gotta go faster.</i>

1761
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:56,080
<i>Faster...! Cooper.</i>

1762
01:54:00,160 --> 01:54:01,600
Hang in there. Come on.

1763
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:11,480
I see him... CASE, bank! Bank right!

1764
01:54:29,400 --> 01:54:31,040
Cooper...!

1765
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:32,600
I'm here!

1766
01:54:54,720 --> 01:54:56,640
This data makes no sense.

1767
01:55:04,640 --> 01:55:05,640
I'm sorry.

1768
01:55:06,120 --> 01:55:07,120
What?

1769
01:55:07,200 --> 01:55:08,720
Mann was lying!

1770
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:17,680
Go...

1771
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:20,040
Romilly.

1772
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:21,280
<i>Romilly!</i>

1773
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:23,600
<i>Romilly! Do you read me, Romilly?</i>

1774
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:24,880
- <i>Romilly!</i>
- Step back

1775
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:26,760
- Professor! Step back!
- <i>Please don't make...</i>

1776
01:55:33,720 --> 01:55:34,720
<i>Romilly...</i>

1777
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:36,600
<i>Romilly, do you... do you read me?</i>

1778
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:40,320
Keep watch!

1779
01:55:41,680 --> 01:55:42,680
Lois?

1780
01:55:43,240 --> 01:55:44,600
What happened to caution, CASE?

1781
01:55:44,680 --> 01:55:45,800
Safety first, Cooper.

1782
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:49,880
Romilly? Romilly, do you read me?
This is Brand.

1783
01:55:53,160 --> 01:55:54,160
Romilly?

1784
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:56,520
Dr. Brand. Cooper.
There's been an explosion.

1785
01:55:57,320 --> 01:55:58,800
Dr. Mann's compound.

1786
01:56:25,480 --> 01:56:27,200
TARS... ten o'clock!

1787
01:56:33,720 --> 01:56:35,200
Let me know when TARS is aboard.

1788
01:56:38,600 --> 01:56:40,320
Romilly did not survive.

1789
01:56:42,040 --> 01:56:43,320
I could not save him.

1790
01:56:43,400 --> 01:56:45,160
- TARS is in.
- I'll take her from here.

1791
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:46,336
Do we have a fix on the Ranger?

1792
01:56:46,360 --> 01:56:47,480
He's pushing into orbit!

1793
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,680
If he takes control of
that ship, we're dead.

1794
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:53,200
He'd maroon us?

1795
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:55,080
He is marooning us.

1796
01:56:56,840 --> 01:56:58,880
I'll meet you guys downstairs.
Go wait by the car.

1797
01:57:06,760 --> 01:57:08,760
Come on! Gimme your bag.

1798
01:57:08,840 --> 01:57:10,960
Go, get in the back seat.
Get in the backseat now!

1799
01:57:16,240 --> 01:57:18,120
<i>Dr. Mann, please respond.</i>

1800
01:57:18,640 --> 01:57:20,720
Dr. Mann, please respond!

1801
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:22,960
He doesn't know
the Endurance docking procedure.

1802
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:24,280
No, the autopilot does.

1803
01:57:24,360 --> 01:57:25,680
Not since TARS disabled it.

1804
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:29,200
Nice. What's
your trust setting, TARS?

1805
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:30,680
Lower than yours apparently.

1806
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:37,600
<i>Do not attempt docking.
I repeat, do not attempt docking.</i>

1807
01:57:37,680 --> 01:57:38,720
<i>Please res...</i>

1808
01:58:35,600 --> 01:58:37,760
<i>Auto-docking sequence withheld.</i>

1809
01:58:38,280 --> 01:58:40,560
- Override.
- <i>Unauthorized.</i>

1810
01:58:41,240 --> 01:58:42,360
Override.

1811
01:58:43,120 --> 01:58:44,440
<i>Unauthorized.</i>

1812
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:50,200
Do not attempt docking. I repeat

1813
01:58:50,280 --> 01:58:52,800
do not attempt docking.
Please resp...

1814
01:59:34,920 --> 01:59:36,680
Moving slowly toward the Endurance.

1815
02:00:00,440 --> 02:00:01,920
<i>Imperfect contact.</i>

1816
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,720
- Override.
- <i>Hatch lockout.</i>

1817
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:12,640
Is he locked on yet?

1818
02:00:12,720 --> 02:00:13,800
Imperfectly.

1819
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:17,000
Dr. Mann, do not...

1820
02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:39,880
<i>Hatch lockout disengaged.</i>

1821
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:52,440
Dr. Mann, do not,
I repeat, do not open the hatch.

1822
02:00:52,520 --> 02:00:53,880
I repeat, do not open the hatch.

1823
02:00:53,960 --> 02:00:56,720
If you open the hatch,
the airlock will depressurize.

1824
02:01:21,880 --> 02:01:23,216
What happens if he blows the airlock?

1825
02:01:23,240 --> 02:01:24,240
Nothing good.

1826
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:31,376
Okay, pull back, pull back.
Retro thrusters

1827
02:01:31,400 --> 02:01:32,456
everything we've got, CASE!

1828
02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:33,760
- Thrusters are full!
- Back!

1829
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:36,080
CASE, relay my transmission
to the on board computer

1830
02:01:36,160 --> 02:01:38,200
and have it rebroadcast
as emergency P.A.

1831
02:01:38,920 --> 02:01:39,960
Dr. Mann...

1832
02:01:40,560 --> 02:01:41,760
<i>open the inner hatch.</i>

1833
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:43,920
<i>I repeat, do not open
the inner hatch.</i>

1834
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:45,800
- <i>I repeat, do not open...</i>
- Brand?

1835
02:01:46,720 --> 02:01:48,240
<i>I don't know what he said to you</i>

1836
02:01:48,680 --> 02:01:50,800
but I am taking command
of the Endurance.

1837
02:01:51,680 --> 02:01:53,720
<i>And then we can talk
about completing the mission.</i>

1838
02:01:56,800 --> 02:01:58,640
Dr. Mann, listen to me.

1839
02:01:59,200 --> 02:02:00,880
This is not about my life.

1840
02:02:01,720 --> 02:02:04,480
Or Cooper's life.
This is about all mankind.

1841
02:02:05,640 --> 02:02:06,680
There is a moment...

1842
02:02:13,040 --> 02:02:14,200
It is not s...

1843
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:23,560
Oh, my God.

1844
02:02:40,840 --> 02:02:42,840
Cooper there's no point
using your fuel

1845
02:02:42,920 --> 02:02:44,680
- to chase...
- Analyze the Endurance's spin.

1846
02:02:49,480 --> 02:02:50,560
Cooper, what are you doing?

1847
02:02:50,840 --> 02:02:51,840
Docking.

1848
02:02:56,040 --> 02:02:58,800
Endurance rotation is 67, 68 RPM.

1849
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:01,360
Okay, get ready to match our spin
with the retro thrusters.

1850
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:02,560
It's not possible.

1851
02:03:02,640 --> 02:03:04,800
No. It's necessary.

1852
02:03:15,960 --> 02:03:17,680
Endurance is hitting stratosphere!

1853
02:03:22,080 --> 02:03:23,520
She's got no heat shield.

1854
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:28,560
- CASE, you ready?
- Ready.

1855
02:03:36,560 --> 02:03:39,400
Cooper! This is no time for caution.

1856
02:03:41,200 --> 02:03:43,280
CASE, if I black out,
you take the stick.

1857
02:03:43,720 --> 02:03:46,040
TARS, get ready to engage
the docking mechanism.

1858
02:03:52,760 --> 02:03:54,280
Endurance is starting to heat.

1859
02:03:54,440 --> 02:03:55,640
20 feet out.

1860
02:03:55,960 --> 02:03:58,200
I need three degrees
starboard, Cooper.

1861
02:03:58,440 --> 02:03:59,640
Ten feet out.

1862
02:04:00,480 --> 02:04:02,920
Cooper, we are lined up.

1863
02:04:03,240 --> 02:04:04,400
Initiating spin!

1864
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:45,680
Come on, TARS.

1865
02:04:53,400 --> 02:04:54,720
Come on, TARS!

1866
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:08,000
- We are locked, Cooper.
- Locked. Easing up!

1867
02:05:15,400 --> 02:05:16,440
Easy.

1868
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:19,120
Easy.

1869
02:05:24,720 --> 02:05:26,120
Retro thrusters!

1870
02:05:33,960 --> 02:05:35,120
Main engines on.

1871
02:05:40,880 --> 02:05:43,560
Pushing out of orbit. Come on, baby.

1872
02:05:51,280 --> 02:05:52,480
Killing main engines!

1873
02:05:54,080 --> 02:05:55,360
Okay, we're out of orbit.

1874
02:06:02,680 --> 02:06:03,680
Okay.

1875
02:06:04,080 --> 02:06:05,600
And for our next trick!

1876
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:10,560
It'll have to be good.
We're heading into Gargantua's pull.

1877
02:06:11,760 --> 02:06:12,800
Oh, shit.

1878
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:15,000
- CASE, take the stick.
- Roger that.

1879
02:07:02,840 --> 02:07:05,520
Cooper, we're slipping
towards Gargantua.

1880
02:07:06,280 --> 02:07:07,760
Shall I use main engines?

1881
02:07:08,360 --> 02:07:09,360
No.

1882
02:07:09,880 --> 02:07:11,880
We got to let her slide
as far as we can.

1883
02:07:20,600 --> 02:07:21,720
Give it to me.

1884
02:07:21,800 --> 02:07:23,520
There's good news,
there's bad news, Cooper.

1885
02:07:23,560 --> 02:07:25,120
Yeah, I've heard that one, TARS.

1886
02:07:26,160 --> 02:07:27,160
Give it to me straight.

1887
02:07:35,560 --> 02:07:36,760
The backup generator kicked in

1888
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:38,520
so the system's stable.
They're all good.

1889
02:07:38,600 --> 02:07:39,640
Good.

1890
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:41,000
Okay.

1891
02:07:41,400 --> 02:07:43,640
The navigational hub
has been completely destroyed.

1892
02:07:43,720 --> 02:07:46,200
We don't have enough life support
to make it back to Earth, but

1893
02:07:46,520 --> 02:07:48,520
I think we can scratch
our way to Edmunds' planet.

1894
02:07:48,720 --> 02:07:49,840
Well, what about fuel?

1895
02:07:50,160 --> 02:07:52,680
Not enough. But I have a plan.

1896
02:07:53,200 --> 02:07:57,200
We let Gargantua pull us down
close to her horizon.

1897
02:07:57,520 --> 02:08:00,720
Then a powered slingshot around,
launching us towards Edmunds' planet.

1898
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:01,800
Manually?

1899
02:08:01,880 --> 02:08:03,080
That's what I'm here for.

1900
02:08:03,400 --> 02:08:05,400
I'm gonna take us
just inside the critical orbit.

1901
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:07,200
What about the time slippage?

1902
02:08:07,280 --> 02:08:10,480
Neither of us has time to worry about
relativity right now, Dr. Brand.

1903
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:16,080
I'm sorry, Cooper.

1904
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:22,200
Once we've gathered
enough speed around Gargantua

1905
02:08:22,600 --> 02:08:24,160
we use Lander One

1906
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:27,600
and Ranger Two as rocket boosters to

1907
02:08:27,920 --> 02:08:29,920
push us out of
the black hole's gravity.

1908
02:08:32,400 --> 02:08:34,600
<i>The Lander's linkages
have been destroyed</i>

1909
02:08:35,120 --> 02:08:37,040
<i>so we'll have to control manually.</i>

1910
02:08:38,520 --> 02:08:41,200
Once Lander one is spent,
TARS will detach

1911
02:08:41,720 --> 02:08:43,680
and get sucked into that black hole.

1912
02:08:44,320 --> 02:08:45,600
Why does TARS have to detach?

1913
02:08:45,680 --> 02:08:48,120
We have to shed the weight
to escape the gravity.

1914
02:08:48,320 --> 02:08:49,760
Newton's third law.

1915
02:08:49,840 --> 02:08:52,560
The only way humans have ever
figured out of getting somewhere

1916
02:08:52,640 --> 02:08:53,920
is to leave something behind.

1917
02:08:54,320 --> 02:08:57,200
Cooper, you can't ask TARS
to do this for us.

1918
02:08:57,280 --> 02:09:01,000
He's a robot. So you don't have
to ask him to do anything.

1919
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:02,520
<i>Cooper, you asshole!</i>

1920
02:09:02,840 --> 02:09:04,520
Sorry, you broke up
a little bit there.

1921
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:06,880
It's what we intended, Dr. Brand.

1922
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:09,840
It's our only chance
to save people on Earth.

1923
02:09:09,920 --> 02:09:13,080
If I can find a way to transmit
the quantum data I'll find in there

1924
02:09:13,520 --> 02:09:14,760
they might still make it.

1925
02:09:16,240 --> 02:09:18,280
Let's just hope
there's still someone there to save.

1926
02:09:46,080 --> 02:09:47,600
Maximum velocity achieved.

1927
02:09:48,720 --> 02:09:50,640
Prepare to fire escape thrusters.

1928
02:09:51,400 --> 02:09:52,400
Ready?

1929
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:53,640
Ready.

1930
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:54,920
Ready.

1931
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:56,800
Main engine ignition in three...

1932
02:09:57,320 --> 02:09:58,360
two...

1933
02:09:58,880 --> 02:10:00,720
one. Mark.

1934
02:10:13,400 --> 02:10:14,640
Come on, baby.

1935
02:10:15,880 --> 02:10:17,880
Lander One engines, on my mark.

1936
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:19,400
Three...

1937
02:10:19,640 --> 02:10:20,720
two...

1938
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:22,760
one. Mark.

1939
02:10:27,480 --> 02:10:29,800
Ranger Two engines, on my mark.

1940
02:10:30,120 --> 02:10:32,600
Three, two, one.

1941
02:10:33,160 --> 02:10:34,200
- Mark.
- Fire!

1942
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:46,800
This little maneuver's
gonna cost us 51 years!

1943
02:10:47,800 --> 02:10:50,080
You don't sound so bad
for pushing 120!

1944
02:11:04,720 --> 02:11:07,880
Lander One, prepare
to detach on my mark.

1945
02:11:08,400 --> 02:11:10,800
Three, two...

1946
02:11:11,560 --> 02:11:13,400
one. Mark.

1947
02:11:13,480 --> 02:11:14,560
Detach!

1948
02:11:17,480 --> 02:11:18,560
<i>Goodbye, TARS.</i>

1949
02:11:19,200 --> 02:11:21,520
Goodbye, Dr. Brand.
See you on the other side, Coop.

1950
02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:23,120
See you there, Slick!

1951
02:11:31,160 --> 02:11:32,400
Okay, CASE.

1952
02:11:33,320 --> 02:11:35,000
Nice reckless flying!

1953
02:11:35,440 --> 02:11:36,640
Learned from the master.

1954
02:11:37,360 --> 02:11:39,600
Ranger Two, prepare to detach.

1955
02:11:39,680 --> 02:11:41,560
What? No... Cooper!

1956
02:11:41,640 --> 02:11:43,200
- Three...
- Cooper, what are you doing?

1957
02:11:43,280 --> 02:11:44,680
Newton's third law.

1958
02:11:45,040 --> 02:11:46,880
- You got to leave something behind.
- Two...

1959
02:11:46,960 --> 02:11:49,040
You told me we had
enough resources for both of us.

1960
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:50,880
- One.
- <i>We agreed, Amelia...</i>

1961
02:11:51,600 --> 02:11:53,320
- 90%.
- Mark.

1962
02:11:54,600 --> 02:11:55,600
Don't.

1963
02:11:57,800 --> 02:11:58,840
Detach.

1964
02:12:11,560 --> 02:12:14,160
Okay, I am nosing down.

1965
02:12:17,880 --> 02:12:19,440
Approaching the event horizon.

1966
02:12:21,880 --> 02:12:24,120
Portside, dipping down beneath it

1967
02:12:24,720 --> 02:12:25,920
to go through it.

1968
02:12:27,720 --> 02:12:30,320
<i>Heading towards blackness.</i>

1969
02:12:30,840 --> 02:12:32,240
<i>I have a visual of the event.</i>

1970
02:12:33,240 --> 02:12:34,280
It's all black.

1971
02:12:36,680 --> 02:12:37,880
TARS, do you read me?

1972
02:12:38,440 --> 02:12:39,680
It's all blackness.

1973
02:12:41,840 --> 02:12:44,000
TARS. Do you read me? Over.

1974
02:12:48,440 --> 02:12:49,440
Okay.

1975
02:12:50,600 --> 02:12:51,680
Screens...

1976
02:12:53,320 --> 02:12:54,560
getting interference.

1977
02:12:56,320 --> 02:12:58,640
Losing control of the stick.
I got flashes.

1978
02:12:59,400 --> 02:13:01,320
Flashes of lightness and blackness.

1979
02:13:02,880 --> 02:13:05,800
The turbulence in the gravity
is increasing.

1980
02:13:11,480 --> 02:13:12,880
The computers are going down.

1981
02:13:24,840 --> 02:13:27,240
Gravitational pull.
I'm losing control of the stick.

1982
02:13:59,560 --> 02:14:01,240
Murph? Murph, come on!

1983
02:14:06,520 --> 02:14:07,520
Eject.

1984
02:14:08,080 --> 02:14:09,080
Eject.

1985
02:14:09,760 --> 02:14:10,760
Eject.

1986
02:14:11,360 --> 02:14:12,360
Eject.

1987
02:14:13,080 --> 02:14:14,080
Eject.

1988
02:14:14,680 --> 02:14:15,680
Eject.

1989
02:16:03,320 --> 02:16:04,360
Murph.

1990
02:16:13,840 --> 02:16:16,000
Murph...!

1991
02:16:24,120 --> 02:16:25,120
Murph!

1992
02:16:32,040 --> 02:16:33,840
No...

1993
02:16:33,920 --> 02:16:35,120
Murph!

1994
02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:36,920
Murph!

1995
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:38,240
No...!

1996
02:17:35,360 --> 02:17:37,200
If you're leaving, just go.

1997
02:17:37,560 --> 02:17:38,800
No...

1998
02:17:40,400 --> 02:17:42,440
No, don't go. Don't go, you idiot.

1999
02:17:42,520 --> 02:17:43,520
Don't go!

2000
02:17:45,760 --> 02:17:47,200
Morse...

2001
02:17:48,040 --> 02:17:49,040
Morse.

2002
02:17:49,920 --> 02:17:50,920
Dot.

2003
02:17:51,360 --> 02:17:52,760
Dot. S.

2004
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:00,000
T.

2005
02:18:04,440 --> 02:18:05,440
A.

2006
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:07,000
Dash!

2007
02:18:09,480 --> 02:18:10,880
Dash! Dash!

2008
02:18:11,560 --> 02:18:14,240
Murph! Murph, we don't
have time for this! Come on!

2009
02:18:14,640 --> 02:18:15,640
Y.

2010
02:18:20,920 --> 02:18:22,000
"Stay!"

2011
02:18:32,560 --> 02:18:34,360
Come on. Come on, Murph...

2012
02:18:34,440 --> 02:18:35,440
Murph, come on!

2013
02:18:35,520 --> 02:18:37,200
What's it say? What's it say, Murph?

2014
02:18:37,880 --> 02:18:38,880
What's it say?

2015
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:50,040
"Stay."

2016
02:19:24,400 --> 02:19:25,560
Tell him, Murph.

2017
02:19:25,920 --> 02:19:27,000
Make him stay.

2018
02:19:29,840 --> 02:19:31,920
Make... Make him stay, Murph.

2019
02:19:40,600 --> 02:19:42,200
Make him stay, Murph.

2020
02:19:43,960 --> 02:19:45,680
Don't let me leave, Murph!

2021
02:19:49,680 --> 02:19:51,440
Don't let me leave, Murph!

2022
02:19:56,840 --> 02:19:59,360
No...!

2023
02:20:19,040 --> 02:20:20,080
It was you.

2024
02:20:31,480 --> 02:20:33,000
You were my ghost.

2025
02:20:42,680 --> 02:20:45,800
<i>Cooper... Come in, Cooper.</i>

2026
02:20:47,280 --> 02:20:48,360
TARS?

2027
02:20:48,440 --> 02:20:49,440
<i>Roger that.</i>

2028
02:20:51,400 --> 02:20:52,600
You survived.

2029
02:20:52,680 --> 02:20:53,760
<i>Somewhere...</i>

2030
02:20:54,480 --> 02:20:58,200
<i>in their fifth dimension.
They saved us.</i>

2031
02:20:58,800 --> 02:21:01,640
Yeah? Who the hell is "they"?

2032
02:21:01,960 --> 02:21:03,720
And just why would
they want to help us?

2033
02:21:03,800 --> 02:21:06,760
<i>I don't know, but they constructed
this three-dimensional space</i>

2034
02:21:06,840 --> 02:21:10,000
<i>inside their five-dimensional reality
to allow you to understand it.</i>

2035
02:21:10,080 --> 02:21:11,520
Yeah, that ain't working.

2036
02:21:12,160 --> 02:21:13,240
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

2037
02:21:13,720 --> 02:21:17,000
<i>You've seen that time is represented
here as a physical dimension.</i>

2038
02:21:17,680 --> 02:21:20,760
<i>You have worked out that you can
exert a force across space-time.</i>

2039
02:21:20,840 --> 02:21:24,280
Yeah, gravity to send a message.

2040
02:21:24,520 --> 02:21:25,560
<i>Affirmative.</i>

2041
02:21:28,240 --> 02:21:29,360
Gravity...

2042
02:21:30,480 --> 02:21:33,600
can cross the dimensions,
including time.

2043
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:35,120
<i>Apparently.</i>

2044
02:21:38,920 --> 02:21:40,760
Do you have the quantum data?

2045
02:21:41,200 --> 02:21:42,520
<i>Roger. I have it.</i>

2046
02:21:43,760 --> 02:21:45,800
<i>I am transmitting it
on all wavelengths</i>

2047
02:21:45,880 --> 02:21:47,600
<i>but nothing is getting out, Cooper.</i>

2048
02:21:47,800 --> 02:21:49,760
I can do this...

2049
02:21:50,160 --> 02:21:52,920
<i>But such complicated data to a child?</i>

2050
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:54,000
Not just any child.

2051
02:21:54,480 --> 02:21:55,600
What else?

2052
02:21:56,120 --> 02:21:57,520
Oh, come on, Dad.

2053
02:22:00,640 --> 02:22:02,240
Murph, the fire's out! Come on!

2054
02:22:02,320 --> 02:22:03,720
<i>Even if you communicate it here</i>

2055
02:22:03,800 --> 02:22:06,200
<i>she won't understand
its significance for years.</i>

2056
02:22:07,120 --> 02:22:08,360
I get that, TARS.

2057
02:22:08,640 --> 02:22:10,480
All right, but we've gotta
figure something out

2058
02:22:10,560 --> 02:22:13,360
or the people on Earth
are gonna die. Think...!

2059
02:22:13,440 --> 02:22:14,520
<i>Cooper...</i>

2060
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:17,080
<i>they didn't bring us here
to change the past.</i>

2061
02:22:20,880 --> 02:22:21,920
Say that again.

2062
02:22:22,440 --> 02:22:25,480
<i>They didn't bring us here
to change the past.</i>

2063
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:31,760
No, they didn't bring us here at all.

2064
02:22:36,480 --> 02:22:37,720
We brought ourselves.

2065
02:22:46,720 --> 02:22:51,000
TARS, give me the coordinates
for NASA in binary.

2066
02:22:51,200 --> 02:22:53,200
<i>In binary. Roger. Feeding data.</i>

2067
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:18,320
"It's not a ghost."

2068
02:23:20,600 --> 02:23:21,800
"It's gravity."

2069
02:23:22,120 --> 02:23:23,480
Don't you get it yet, TARS?

2070
02:23:24,440 --> 02:23:25,760
I brought myself here!

2071
02:23:27,040 --> 02:23:29,920
We're here to communicate
with the three-dimensional world.

2072
02:23:30,680 --> 02:23:31,760
We're the bridge!

2073
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:41,320
I thought they chose me.

2074
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:46,680
But they didn't choose me,
they chose her.

2075
02:23:46,760 --> 02:23:47,920
<i>For what, Cooper?</i>

2076
02:23:50,720 --> 02:23:52,000
To save the world.

2077
02:23:56,320 --> 02:23:59,200
All of this is
one little girl's bedroom.

2078
02:23:59,280 --> 02:24:00,520
Every moment.

2079
02:24:01,040 --> 02:24:02,320
It's infinitely complex.

2080
02:24:02,400 --> 02:24:04,680
They have access
to infinite time and space

2081
02:24:04,760 --> 02:24:06,720
but they're not bound by anything!

2082
02:24:06,800 --> 02:24:10,480
They can't find
a specific place in time.

2083
02:24:10,560 --> 02:24:11,720
They can't communicate.

2084
02:24:13,040 --> 02:24:15,920
That's why I'm here.
I'm gonna find a way to tell Murph

2085
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:17,320
just like I found this moment.

2086
02:24:17,400 --> 02:24:19,680
- <i>How, Cooper?</i>
- Love, TARS, love.

2087
02:24:19,960 --> 02:24:21,000
It's just like Brand said.

2088
02:24:21,080 --> 02:24:24,480
My connection with Murph,
it is quantifiable. It's the key!

2089
02:24:24,560 --> 02:24:25,760
<i>What are we here to do?</i>

2090
02:24:27,320 --> 02:24:28,440
Find how to tell her.

2091
02:24:31,640 --> 02:24:32,680
The watch.

2092
02:24:35,880 --> 02:24:36,920
The watch.

2093
02:24:38,400 --> 02:24:39,440
That's it.

2094
02:24:41,920 --> 02:24:44,320
We code the data into
the movement of the second hand.

2095
02:24:48,200 --> 02:24:51,360
TARS, translate the data into Morse
and feed it to me.

2096
02:24:51,440 --> 02:24:55,200
<i>Translating data to Morse. Cooper,
what if she never came back for it?</i>

2097
02:24:57,040 --> 02:24:59,800
She will...

2098
02:25:01,080 --> 02:25:02,440
Murph, I can see his car!

2099
02:25:03,720 --> 02:25:04,760
He's coming, Murph!

2100
02:25:06,480 --> 02:25:08,320
Okay. I'm coming down.

2101
02:25:09,560 --> 02:25:10,840
<i>How do you know?</i>

2102
02:25:14,160 --> 02:25:15,800
Because I gave it to her.

2103
02:25:21,080 --> 02:25:23,200
<i>Roger. Morse is dot-dot-dash-dot.</i>

2104
02:25:27,080 --> 02:25:28,080
Dot-dot...

2105
02:25:29,160 --> 02:25:30,840
dash-dot.

2106
02:25:31,280 --> 02:25:32,880
<i>Dot-dash-dot-dot.</i>

2107
02:25:33,360 --> 02:25:35,880
Dot-dash-dot-dot.

2108
02:25:36,200 --> 02:25:37,720
<i>Dash-dash-dash.</i>

2109
02:25:37,800 --> 02:25:40,120
Dash, dash, dash.

2110
02:25:57,320 --> 02:25:58,360
He came back!

2111
02:25:59,480 --> 02:26:03,320
It was him all the time!
I didn't know. It was him!

2112
02:26:04,600 --> 02:26:06,120
Dad's gonna save us.

2113
02:26:47,560 --> 02:26:48,800
Eureka!

2114
02:26:52,240 --> 02:26:53,560
It's traditional.

2115
02:26:57,840 --> 02:26:59,720
Eureka!

2116
02:27:04,080 --> 02:27:05,120
Did it work?

2117
02:27:05,720 --> 02:27:07,040
<i>I think it might have.</i>

2118
02:27:08,960 --> 02:27:10,800
- How do you know?
- <i>Because</i>

2119
02:27:10,880 --> 02:27:13,000
<i>the bulk beings
are closing the tesseract.</i>

2120
02:27:17,120 --> 02:27:18,680
Don't you get it yet, TARS?

2121
02:27:20,040 --> 02:27:21,360
They're not "beings."

2122
02:27:22,560 --> 02:27:23,560
They're us.

2123
02:27:25,800 --> 02:27:28,640
What I've been doing for Murph,
they're doing for me.

2124
02:27:29,360 --> 02:27:30,400
For all of us.

2125
02:27:30,720 --> 02:27:32,560
<i>Cooper, people couldn't build this.</i>

2126
02:27:33,120 --> 02:27:35,360
No. No, not yet.

2127
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:37,040
But one day.

2128
02:27:37,760 --> 02:27:39,000
Not you and me.

2129
02:27:39,800 --> 02:27:40,880
But people.

2130
02:27:41,640 --> 02:27:45,200
<i>A civilization that's evolved
past the four dimensions we know.</i>

2131
02:27:51,760 --> 02:27:52,800
What happens now?

2132
02:28:53,320 --> 02:28:54,400
Mr. Cooper.

2133
02:28:58,720 --> 02:29:00,120
All right. Let's take it slow, sir.

2134
02:29:00,680 --> 02:29:02,000
Nice and easy, Mr. Cooper.

2135
02:29:02,920 --> 02:29:04,760
Remember, you're no
spring chicken anymore.

2136
02:29:04,840 --> 02:29:07,280
Actually, you are 124 years old.

2137
02:29:14,480 --> 02:29:15,520
Take it slow, sir.

2138
02:29:16,720 --> 02:29:18,640
You were extremely lucky.

2139
02:29:19,320 --> 02:29:22,000
The Rangers found you with only
minutes left in your oxygen supply.

2140
02:29:35,880 --> 02:29:37,000
Where am I?

2141
02:29:38,880 --> 02:29:39,920
Cooper Station.

2142
02:29:41,720 --> 02:29:43,120
Currently orbiting Saturn.

2143
02:29:45,040 --> 02:29:46,920
Cooper Station.

2144
02:29:49,600 --> 02:29:51,440
Nice of you to name it after me.

2145
02:29:55,120 --> 02:29:56,400
- What?
- The station

2146
02:29:56,480 --> 02:29:57,640
isn't named after you, sir.

2147
02:29:57,720 --> 02:29:59,320
It's... It's named
after your daughter.

2148
02:29:59,920 --> 02:30:02,840
Although she's always maintained
just how important you were.

2149
02:30:02,920 --> 02:30:04,160
Is she still alive?

2150
02:30:06,400 --> 02:30:07,880
She'll be here in a couple weeks.

2151
02:30:09,160 --> 02:30:11,520
She is far too old to be transferring
from another station

2152
02:30:11,600 --> 02:30:13,280
but when she heard
that you'd been found...

2153
02:30:15,040 --> 02:30:17,600
well, this is... this is
Murphy Cooper we're talking about.

2154
02:30:18,440 --> 02:30:19,680
Yes, it is.

2155
02:30:22,240 --> 02:30:24,280
We'll have you checked out of here
in a couple days.

2156
02:30:27,200 --> 02:30:29,520
I'm sure you'll be excited
to see what's in store.

2157
02:30:30,600 --> 02:30:34,560
I actually did a paper on you
in high school.

2158
02:30:34,640 --> 02:30:36,520
I know all about
your life back on Earth.

2159
02:30:38,480 --> 02:30:39,480
Oh, yeah.

2160
02:30:39,920 --> 02:30:40,920
Right.

2161
02:30:43,360 --> 02:30:48,200
If... If you'll follow me, we've got
a really good situation for you.

2162
02:30:51,560 --> 02:30:55,200
So, when I made my suggestion
to Miss Cooper

2163
02:30:56,440 --> 02:30:59,240
I was delighted to hear
that she thought it was perfect.

2164
02:31:02,480 --> 02:31:05,520
It was just constant.
Just that steady blow of dirt.

2165
02:31:05,600 --> 02:31:08,400
Of course, I... I didn't
speak to her personally.

2166
02:31:08,480 --> 02:31:10,400
<i>We always set the plate upside-down.</i>

2167
02:31:10,480 --> 02:31:13,120
<i>Glasses or cups,
whatever it was, upside-down.</i>

2168
02:31:13,480 --> 02:31:18,000
<i>Well, my dad was a farmer.
Like everybody else back then.</i>

2169
02:31:18,320 --> 02:31:20,800
<i>There just wasn't enough food.</i>

2170
02:31:20,880 --> 02:31:22,800
<i>We wore little things</i>

2171
02:31:23,480 --> 02:31:25,200
<i>little strips of sheet with</i>

2172
02:31:25,280 --> 02:31:28,760
<i>sometimes over our nose and mouth
so we wouldn't breathe...</i>

2173
02:31:28,840 --> 02:31:31,680
<i>Well, it was pretty exciting for me
because it was hope.</i>

2174
02:31:32,200 --> 02:31:33,760
<i>I don't care who describes that...</i>

2175
02:31:33,840 --> 02:31:35,280
<i>That no one exaggerates that.</i>

2176
02:31:35,360 --> 02:31:36,400
<i>There is no way for it...</i>

2177
02:31:36,480 --> 02:31:39,880
She did confirm
just how much you loved farming.

2178
02:31:40,320 --> 02:31:41,880
- Oh, she did, did she?
- Yeah.

2179
02:31:41,960 --> 02:31:43,000
Come here.

2180
02:31:43,760 --> 02:31:44,760
Home sweet home.

2181
02:31:45,120 --> 02:31:48,280
Everything replaced
and put back where it...

2182
02:31:54,720 --> 02:31:56,280
- Hey, is this...
- Oh, yeah.

2183
02:31:56,360 --> 02:31:59,800
The... The machine we found out
near Saturn when we found you. Yes.

2184
02:32:00,120 --> 02:32:01,120
Its power source was shot

2185
02:32:01,200 --> 02:32:02,496
but we could get you
another one if you want.

2186
02:32:02,520 --> 02:32:04,400
Yes. Please.

2187
02:32:05,800 --> 02:32:06,800
Settings.

2188
02:32:07,520 --> 02:32:08,760
General settings.

2189
02:32:09,480 --> 02:32:10,880
Security settings.

2190
02:32:13,840 --> 02:32:15,760
Honesty, new setting:

2191
02:32:17,080 --> 02:32:18,520
95%.

2192
02:32:18,840 --> 02:32:21,400
Confirmed. Additional customization?

2193
02:32:22,200 --> 02:32:23,240
Humor:

2194
02:32:24,840 --> 02:32:26,160
75%.

2195
02:32:26,520 --> 02:32:27,520
Confirmed.

2196
02:32:28,320 --> 02:32:31,560
Auto self-destruct
T-minus ten, nine...

2197
02:32:31,640 --> 02:32:33,120
Let's make that 60%.

2198
02:32:35,640 --> 02:32:37,320
60% confirmed.

2199
02:32:38,320 --> 02:32:39,360
Knock-knock.

2200
02:32:39,560 --> 02:32:41,000
You want 55?

2201
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:47,560
Is this really what it was like?

2202
02:32:50,200 --> 02:32:51,920
It was never this clean, Slick.

2203
02:32:56,840 --> 02:33:00,720
I don't care much for this pretending
we're back where we started.

2204
02:33:02,280 --> 02:33:04,200
I wanna know where we are.

2205
02:33:06,080 --> 02:33:07,320
Where we're going.

2206
02:33:11,840 --> 02:33:12,960
- Mr. Cooper.
- Yeah.

2207
02:33:13,040 --> 02:33:14,520
The family's all in there.

2208
02:33:15,120 --> 02:33:16,120
Family?

2209
02:33:16,200 --> 02:33:17,600
Yeah, they all came out to see her.

2210
02:33:17,640 --> 02:33:19,800
She's been in cryo-sleep
for almost two years.

2211
02:33:51,600 --> 02:33:53,400
You told them I like farming.

2212
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:00,480
It was me, Murph.

2213
02:34:03,280 --> 02:34:04,720
I was your ghost.

2214
02:34:06,080 --> 02:34:07,320
I know.

2215
02:34:09,400 --> 02:34:10,840
People didn't believe me.

2216
02:34:10,920 --> 02:34:13,640
They thought
that I was doing it all myself.

2217
02:34:14,040 --> 02:34:15,040
But...

2218
02:34:17,840 --> 02:34:19,360
I knew who it was.

2219
02:34:24,280 --> 02:34:26,000
Nobody believed me.

2220
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:28,920
But I knew you'd come back.

2221
02:34:31,640 --> 02:34:32,640
How?

2222
02:34:34,720 --> 02:34:37,520
Because my dad promised me.

2223
02:34:43,640 --> 02:34:45,240
Well, I'm here now, Murph.

2224
02:34:46,720 --> 02:34:47,760
I'm here.

2225
02:34:49,400 --> 02:34:50,480
No.

2226
02:34:52,720 --> 02:34:56,400
No parent should have to watch
their own child die.

2227
02:34:59,400 --> 02:35:01,720
I have my kids here for me now.

2228
02:35:04,440 --> 02:35:05,760
You go.

2229
02:35:08,920 --> 02:35:10,120
Where?

2230
02:35:13,880 --> 02:35:14,880
Brand.

2231
02:35:24,280 --> 02:35:26,320
<i>She's out there...</i>

2232
02:35:31,960 --> 02:35:33,400
<i>setting up camp.</i>

2233
02:35:59,600 --> 02:36:00,720
<i>Alone...</i>

2234
02:36:02,240 --> 02:36:04,320
<i>in a strange galaxy.</i>

2235
02:36:15,200 --> 02:36:19,880
<i>Maybe right now
she's settling in for the long nap...</i>

2236
02:36:37,240 --> 02:36:39,680
<i>by the light of our new sun...</i>

2237
02:36:54,720 --> 02:36:56,640
<i>in our new home.</i>
